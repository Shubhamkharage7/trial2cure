Scientists think that a person's own immune system, directed by genetic and environmental factors play a major role in its development. Participation involves a blood draw, a brief medical history questionnaire and measurements of height and weight. Some participants will be asked to return for annual follow-up visits for 10 years.",

There has been a rise in the number of cases diagnosed as well as a decrease in the age of diagnosis. This project aims to understand the disease progression as seen in the immune system and to define the genetic and environmental factors that affect inflammation and regulation, which could determine disease progression or nonprogression. Families that include a family member with T1D will be recruited, as well as unrelated, healthy controls as a comparison group.\n\nParticipants will have height and weight measured, complete a social \\& medical history questionnaire, and have blood drawn for analysis for HLA haplotype (a genetic sequence related to type 1 diabetes susceptibility)diabetes, blood glucose, immune system response, complete blood count, and autoantibody measurements. Some family members may return for follow-up visits for up to 10 years."
