            "briefSummary": "Primary Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending oral doses of MEB-1170 in healthy subjects.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To determine the single and multiple oral dose pharmacokinetic profiles of MEB-1170 and the primary metabolite, M373, in healthy subjects.\n2. To determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oral dose of MEB-1170 in healthy subjects.\n3. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) response following single and multiple oral doses of MEB-1170",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design: This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple oral dose study conducted in two parts:\n\nPart A: SAD+FE:\n\nPart A will comprise a single ascending dose (SAD), sequential cohort study, incorporating a food effect (FE) evaluation. Up to 40 subjects will be studied in 5 cohorts (Cohorts A1 to A5), each cohort consisting of 8 subjects (6 treated with MEB-1170, 2 treated with placebo).\n\nSubjects in Cohorts A1, A2, A4 and A5 will participate in 1 treatment period only, residing at the CRU from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 3 (48 hours postdose). Subjects in Cohort A3 will participate in 2 treatment periods (once in fasted state, once in fed state) separated by a minimum of 6 days. All subjects will return for a poststudy visit approximately 5 to 7 days after their final dose.\n\nEach Cohort will include sentinel dosing such that two subjects (one active and one placebo) will be dosed at least 48 hours before the remaining subjects in the cohort. Continuation to dose the remaining subjects will be at the Investigator's discretion, in consultation with the Sponsor.\n\nAll doses will be administered in accordance with a randomization schedule in the fasted state in the morning of Day 1, except for Cohort A3 Treatment Period 2 where MEB-1170 will be given 30 minutes after start of a high fat breakfast (see below). Each subject in Cohorts A1, A2, A4 and A5 will receive only a single dose of MEB-1170 or placebo during the study.\n\nSubjects in Cohort A3 will participate in a 2-period treatment design in which they will be assessed for both the single-dose of MEB-1170 in a Fed and in a Fasted condition. Subjects will receive the same treatment (ie, either MEB-1170 or placebo) in both Period 1 and Period 2, and thus subjects will receive either two single doses of MEB-1170 or two single doses of placebo during the study. Fasting state assessments will occur in Period 1 and Fed state assessments in Period 2.\n\nSAD Assessments:\n\n* Safety/tolerability throughout study\n* Physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECG\n* PK concentrations\n* PD assessments (pupillometry, capnography, oximetry, cold pressor testing)\n\nFollowing the completion of each cohort, a safety and tolerability review will be conducted by the Safety Review Committee (SRC; see below) prior to proceeding to the next cohort. Based on this review, a decision may be made to continue the study as planned, repeat the same dose in another Cohort, assess a lower dose, add an intermediate dose, or terminate the study. Additionally, if no dose limiting toxicities are seen, further cohorts at higher doses may be added.\n\nPart B: MAD:\n\nPart B will comprise a multiple ascending dose (MAD), sequential cohort study. This part will be initiated after the first three SAD cohorts have been fully evaluated for safety and tolerability and the SRC has concluded that the MAD portion may commence. Up to 32 subjects will be studied in 4 cohorts (Cohorts B1 to B4), each cohort consisting of 8 subjects.\n\nIn each of Cohorts B1 to B4, 6 subjects will receive MEB-1170 and 2 will receive placebo. Once-daily dosing will occur on Days 1 to 7, inclusive, for all subjects. Each subject will participate in 1 treatment period only, residing at the CRU from the evening of Day -1 (the day before dosing) until the morning of Day 9 (48 hours after the final dose on Day 7).\n\nAll subjects will return for a poststudy visit 6 to 8 days after their final dose for a final safety assessment.\n\nDose levels to be studied will be determined following review of data from Part A. Following completion of each cohort in Part B, a safety and tolerability review will be conducted by the SRC prior to proceeding to the next cohort (see below). Based on this review, a decision may be made to continue the study as planned, repeat the same dose in another Cohort, assess a lower dose, add an intermediate dose or terminate the study. Additionally, if no dose limiting toxicities are seen, further cohorts at higher doses may be added.\n\nMAD Assessments:\n\n* Safety/tolerability throughout study\n* Physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, and ECG\n* PK concentration (see Schedule of Assessments for details)\n* PD assessments (pupillometry, capnography, cold pressor testing, oximetry)\n\nReference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:\n\nMatching placebo capsule administered orally."
