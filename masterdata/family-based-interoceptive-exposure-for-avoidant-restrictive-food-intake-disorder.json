            "briefSummary": "This project aims to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a comprehensive mind and body intervention; specifically a mindfulness-based interoceptive exposure (MBIE) for families of youth diagnosed with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). This project will: (1) explore the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and data collection procedures with youth with ARFID at end of treatment, (2) establish the acceptability and adherence of the MBIE intervention, and (3) evaluate the number of MBIE sessions required to observe changes in the number of foods avoided and mindfulness skills.",
            "detailedDescription": "A total of 57 individuals with ARFID ages 12-18 will be enrolled to outpatient mindfulness-based interoceptive exposure (MBIE). MBIE targets increasing psychological flexibility and acceptance by decreasing avoidance and attempts to control distressing or undesired internal experiences, and includes psychoeducation, targeted mindfulness practice, in vivo exposures, and counter-conditioning. MBIE will be administered in 20 sessions. Interview, self-report, anthropometrics, laboratory feeding, and behavioral task data will be used to characterize the sample to their response to treatment over time. Follow-up assessments will be completed at session 5, 10, 15, and 20. The final assessment will take place 3 months after treatment ends. Total participation will last 9 months."
