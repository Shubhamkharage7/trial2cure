The study will primarily examine patients ability to complete RT, changes in a patients' daily function and self-reported toxicities. To collect this information, study participants will be asked to complete surveys and physical and cognitive function assessments at five different timepoints in their treatment: before RT, End of RT, and at 1, 3, and 6 months follow up visits. Findings of this study will help radiation oncologists make more informed decisions for future patients receiving RT."
