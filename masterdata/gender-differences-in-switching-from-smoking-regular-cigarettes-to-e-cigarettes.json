Studying the differences between men and women may increase understanding about the effects of switching from smoking regular cigarettes to electronic cigarettes.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the effects of switching to nicotine versus (vs.) placebo standard research E-cigarettes (SRECs) from combustible cigarettes (CCs) on product use, product acceptability, reinforcement, and nicotine dependence symptoms among adult daily CC smokers.\n\nII. To characterize the differences between male and female CC smokers when switching to nicotine versus (vs.) placebo SRECs from CCs on product use, product acceptability, reinforcement, and nicotine dependence symptoms.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To characterize which factors moderate or mediate the effects of switching to nicotine and placebo SRECs from CCs among male and female CC smokers.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will be instructed to smoke their usual brand cigarette as they normally would in weeks 1-2 (Phase I) and to use only the SREC (with or without nicotine) in weeks 3-4 (Phase II) and in weeks 5-6 (Phase III). Participant assignment to SREC type at Phases II and III will be counter-balanced within group, with half of men and women receiving the placebo SREC during Phase II and half during Phase III. Participants will attend 4 laboratory visits with study investigators for 3 hours each over 6 weeks of study participation."
