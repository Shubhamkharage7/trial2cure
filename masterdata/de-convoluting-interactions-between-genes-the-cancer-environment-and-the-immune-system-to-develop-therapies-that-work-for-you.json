BC patients enrolled in this study are consented to enable investigators to generate a biobank of tumor tissue (obtained from surgically removed excess that would otherwise be disposed off ) and matched blood cells ( obtained from an already existing line or a venipuncture ordered per standard of care testing) at key timepoints in their treatment course."
