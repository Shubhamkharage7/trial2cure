            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research study is to investigate a new, targeted intervention to improve outcomes for those suffering from insomnia by attempting to enhance the brain rhythms within the frontal lobe implicated in slow wave generation during the transition from wake to sleep. The device applies a pulsed trapezoidal direct current waveform at 0.75 Hz to the frontal areas of the brain immediately prior to attempted sleep onset to facilitate the transition to sleep.\n\nDuring this cross-over trial, patients will be asked to use a PeakSleep wearable neurotechnology prototype headband, which delivers \\<14 minutes of frontal tDCS over a 30-minute period, immediately before trying to fall asleep. Using an active stimulation versus sham paradigm, we will compare actigraphy data, physiological data, and subjective sleep measures against a pre-treatment baseline in the same patient.\n\nParticipants will complete five in-person visits over the course of the 8-week study. The first visit includes the collection of baseline self-reported data and actigraphy device training. All subsequent visits involve headset training, downloading PeakSleep and actigraphy data, repeating self-reported data measures, and reporting user experience with the device. Participants will not perform any formal sleep study visits and instead provide daily actigraphy data via a FitBit and EEG data when wearing PeakSleep in their own home."

The authors cite two case studies of tES use in pregnant women with no impact or safety risk for the mother or fetus when tES was applied to the head at 2mA and 20-30 min per day. The recommendation by the authors is to verbally enquire as to the pregnancy status of the subjects and only deliver tES when the benefit outweighs risk. Here we propose to completely exclude this population if the questionnaire reveals they are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant. In the event that the patient is untruthful regarding their pregnancy status we view the risk as insignificant given these reported studies and the fact that our dose is \\<\u00bc the dose used in them. For this reason we have chosen not to perform a urine test to screen for pregnancy as we view it as an obtrusive and unnecessary step given the risk profile.",
