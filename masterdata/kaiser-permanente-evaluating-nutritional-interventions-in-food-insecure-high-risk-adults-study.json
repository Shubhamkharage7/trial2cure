            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of receiving 6 months of monetary support for healthy food through a food delivery platform on change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with glycemic control that is above target level.\n\nThe main study aims are to:\n\n1. To evaluate whether providing monthly financial support for home-delivered healthy food vs. only free food delivery through the Instacart platform reduces glycosylated hemoglobin levels within 6 months among Medi-Cal-insured Kaiser Permanente adult members with diabetes mellitus and suboptimal glycemic control.\n2. To evaluate whether providing monthly financial support for home-delivered healthy food vs. only free food delivery through the Instacart platform reduces medical resource utilization within 6 months among Medi-Cal-insured Kaiser Permanente adult members with diabetes mellitus and suboptimal glycemic control.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible Kaiser Permanente adult members will be randomized to one of two groups:\n\n1. Intervention arm, in which subjects will receive 6 months of monetary support (with up to 4 free home deliveries and no service fees) through the Instacart platform to select and receive healthy foods (e.g., vegetables and fruit).\n2. Control arm, in which subjects will receive 6 months of free home deliveries and no service fees for up to 4 deliveries each month through the Instacart platform.\n\nGlycosylated hemoglobin level will be assessed at baseline and at 6 months after enrollment. Medical resource utilization will be evaluated at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment. Patient-reported outcomes (i.e., diabetes quality of life, nutrition security, dietary habits, social needs, and food security) will also be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment."
