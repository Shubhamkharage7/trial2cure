This includes assessing patient experience measures (satisfaction with the visit, perceived empathy, communication effectiveness) as well as greater engagement in their healthcare (patient activation). The investigators will also see what factors might be associated with sleep disturbance and if addressing sleep leads to an intervention such as cognitive behavioral therapy.",

For the purposes of this trial, The investigators will include people with lesser degrees of sleep disturbance including anyone with a score greater than 3. For people that are enrolled in the trial, the researcher will record the PSQI score and enter at the first page of survey filled out by the patient after meeting. P The patients in the intervention group will include those for whom their clinician was given their sleep questionnaire result before the visit. The control group will include patients whose clinicians do not view the results, simulating usual care. Patients in both groups will fill out a survey entailing demographics, sleep quality, JSPPPE."
