Patient has significant traumatic injury within 28 days before screening.\n14. Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy that has been diagnosed or required therapy within 2 years before screening.

Women who are unwilling, if not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception from the time of randomization and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Men who are unwilling, if not surgically sterile, to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception from the time of randomization and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Refer to Appendix G for acceptable methods of contraception.\n20. Women who are pregnant, as documented by a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) pregnancy test consistent with pregnancy, obtained within 7 days before the treatment assignment. Females with \u03b2-hCG values that are within the range for pregnancy but are not pregnant (false positives) may be enrolled with written consent of the investigator, after pregnancy has been ruled out. Females of non-childbearing potential (postmenopausal for more than 1 year; bilateral tubal ligation; bilateral oophorectomy; hysterectomy) do not require a serum \u03b2-hCG test.\n21. Women who are breastfeeding.\n22. Patients who have prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical condition, surgical history, physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the patient; alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug; or impair the assessment of study results.\n23.
