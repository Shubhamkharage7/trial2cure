Narratives provide a powerful framework for understanding patient problems and the larger process of illness, coping, and seeking health care. Narratives can provide meaning, context, and perspective for patients' situations and insight into failures in health care delivery, particularly for marginalized patients. MyPaTH Story Booth will provide simple instructions for how participants can work with an interview partner (e.g., a family member or friend) to record their story. MyPath Story Booth may be launched sequentially at each PaTH site to establish an initial archive of patient and caregiver narratives. Individuals who record narratives will be asked to provide limited \"tags\" to populate a searchable database (e.g., their age, sex, interview topic). The audio booth and procedures will also be made available to PaTH affiliated researchers who wish to augment the narrative database with narratives of patient partners from specific study populations."
