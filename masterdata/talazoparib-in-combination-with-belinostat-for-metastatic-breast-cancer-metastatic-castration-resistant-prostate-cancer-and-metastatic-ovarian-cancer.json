A woman of reproductive potential is defined as a premenopausal female with intact uterus and ovaries. For women, non-childbearing potential is defined as:\n\n  * \u226545 years of age and has not had menses for \\>2 years.\n  * Amenorrheic for \\<2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a follicle-stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon pre-study (screening) evaluation.\n  * Post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous or current treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)S.\n* Participation in other investigational studies concurrently if these therapies include a therapeutic intervention.\n* Treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days (or 5 serum half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer) of enrollment.\n* Evidence of current serious uncontrolled concomitant cardiovascular nervous system, pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease), renal, hepatic, endocrine (include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) or gastrointestinal disease.\n* History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator, including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction or arterial thromboembolic events within 6 months prior to screening or severe or unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV disease, or a QTc interval \\> 450 msec.\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus.\n  * Another known malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.\n  * Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n  * Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Any contraindication to oral agents or significant nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, or significant small bowel resection that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude adequate absorption.\n* Allergy to talazoparib, belinostat or to the inactive components of talazoparib or belinostat formulations.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n* QTc \u2265 450 ms or congenital long QT syndrome given potential for prolongation with belinostat.\n* Current or anticipated use within 7 days prior to enrollment, or anticipated use during the study of drugs which are moderate or strong inhibitors of UGT1A1 per protocol.\n* Current or anticipated use within 7 days prior to enrollment, or anticipated use during the study, of strong P-gp inhibitors per protocol.\n* Subjects homozygous for UGT1A1\\*28 allele; this will be determined via clinical testing by polymerase chain reaction with capillary electrophoresis by the University of Michigan Molecular Diagnostics laboratory.\n* Any medical or psychological condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator would interfere with safe completion of the trial.",
