            "briefSummary": "This trial investigates whether hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (hpMRI) can predict treatment response in patients with thyroid cancer and other malignancies of the head and neck undergoing radiation therapy and/or receiving systemic therapy before surgery. An hpMRI is like a standard MRI but involves the use of an imaging contrast agent called hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate. Diagnostic procedures, such as hpMRI, may predict a patient's response to treatment and may help plan the best treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To obtain pilot metabolic imaging data from hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (hpMRI) methods in patients with thyroid tumors or other malignancies of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and/or systemic therapy (e.g., target therapy, checkpoint inhibitors).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess early metabolic changes in response to nonsurgical therapy, including standard-of-care fractionated XRT and/or systemic therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Healthy volunteers undergo MRI over 30 minutes.\n\nARM II: Patients with thyroid cancer and other malignancies of the head and neck undergo hpMRI over 30 minutes at baseline, and at 1 week after the initiation of treatment. During the scan, patients also receive hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 30 seconds and may receive a standard MRI contrast agent at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, thyroid cancer and other malignancies of the head and neck patients are followed up at 1 day."
