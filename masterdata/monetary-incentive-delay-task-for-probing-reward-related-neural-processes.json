            "briefSummary": "150 males and 150 females ages 14-17 years-old will be enrolled in an observational, longitudinal study. There are three planned in-person visits: a baseline assessment, an 18-month follow-up, and a 36-month follow-up. The in-person visits will include assessment of substance use and other individual differences (e.g., reward function, psychiatric history), neuromelanin-sensitive MRI, as well as functional brain activation collected while the participant is at rest (resting-state fMRI) and while the participant completes a Monetary Incentive Delay task. Subjects will also be asked to complete past 90-day substance use assessments remotely every 90 days for 36 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Substance use disorders affect several million people in the United States every year, create significant economic burden, and cause tremendous suffering at the person, family, and societal levels. This proposal aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between pediatric substance use (a risk factor for substance use disorders) and rate of neuromelanin accumulation (a proxy for dopamine function) for the first time. Thus, this research seeks to identify a brain mechanism (dopamine function) that could be targeted in youth by future treatments in order to prevent onset of substance use disorders.\n\nThe goals of this study require a prospective imaging design that relies on the naturally-occurring adolescent substance use (e.g., differences in timing and amount of substance use is treated as quasi-experimental). Importantly, we will begin data collection in a cohort on the cusp of entering a high-risk period of substance use initiation and conclude data collection after 36-months to capture substance use escalation. An intermediate 18-month follow-up NM-MRI scan is needed to help clarify the magnitude of early changes in NM accumulation. Thus, this is a longitudinal, observational study.\n\nOf note, the use of the Monetary Incentive Delay fMRI task at baseline, 18-month, and 36-month follow-ups fulfills the NIH criteria of a basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH). Thus, this study as a whole qualifies as a clinical trial based on the determination:\n\n1. The study involves humans\n2. The participants are prospectively assigned to an intervention, which in this case means that the subject will be assigned to complete the Monetary Incentive Delay fMRI task while lying in the MRI scanner.\n3. The study is designed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on participants, which in this case means that we will evaluate the effect of the Monetary Incentive Delay task on brain activation in participants.\n4. The effect being evaluated is a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome, which in this case means fMRI brain activation between win and loss conditions, as well as between phases of anticipation and consummation/outcome.\n\nIn brief, use of this fMRI task is a single arm, non-masked, non-randomized, basic science intervention. This does not match any of the NIH-defined clinical trials phases (n/a). The fMRI data (brain activation) is the primary outcome measure of the BESH intervention, but is a tertiary outcome in the context of this longitudinal study. The task is utilized for its short-lived, reversible, and benign effects (e.g., brief changes in brain activation)."
