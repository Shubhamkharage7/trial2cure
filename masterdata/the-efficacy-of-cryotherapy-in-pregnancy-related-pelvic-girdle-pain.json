The investigators hypothesize that superficial cryotherapy, in addition to receipt of an educational pamphlet, will result in improved NPRS scores compared to receipt of an educational pamphlet alone.\n\nThis study will include English-speaking pregnant women presenting to Loyola University Medical Center obstetrics or rehabilitation clinics in their second or third trimester with posterior pelvic girdle pain, defined as an NPRS score \\> 2 onset within the past 3 months and pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ). The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can also occur in conjunction with/or separately in the \\[pubic\\] symphysis. NPRS scores will be measured as a continuous, numerical integer ranging from a value of 0 (No pain) to a value of 10 (Worst possible pain)."
