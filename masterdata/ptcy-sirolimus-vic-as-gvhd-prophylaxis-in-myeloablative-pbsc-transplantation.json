Phase II will be powered to improve grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease and relapse after alloHCT, compared to historical estimates at the University of Minnesota.\n\nPatients will receive myeloablative conditioning (MAC) with total body irradiation (TBI) followed by infusion of HLA-matched related or unrelated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on day 0. Cyclophosphamide will be administered on days +3 and +4. Sirolimus targeting 8-12ng/ml will begin on day +5 until day +365. VIC-1911 will be administered as 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg orally BID from day +5 to day +45 according to the rules of our phase I study. The lowest biologically active and safe dose of VIC-1911 will be identified as the recommended phase II dose."
