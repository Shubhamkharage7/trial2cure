            "detailedDescription": "The specific aim of this project is to examine whether Veterans with mild Traumatic Brain Injuries are at risk for dementia by studying their memory, brain wave activity, brain structure and proteins that can be elevated after brain injury and in dementia.\n\nThis study will recruit patients with a history of mild-moderate traumatic brain injury, mild cognitive impairment, as well as healthy controls in order to better understand how single or repetitive mild Traumatic brain injuries may contribute to the development of dementia. It will be prospective in nature. Participants will be asked to complete a series of 3 study sessions. During the first study session, each subject will be asked to complete a neuropsychological assessment. If the subject's testing scores fall under the study criteria, they will also be asked to complete a computer task. In the second study session, the investigators will measure the subjects brain waves using an EEG while they complete a computer task. During the computer task, subjects will be asked to study a list of words and the investigators will test the subjects on their memory for those words. During the final study session, the investigators will ask subjects to complete (1) an MRI scan, (2) a standard blood draw procedure, and (3) a lumbar puncture procedure.\n\nClinical Implications: These studies will provide a better understanding of which individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury will develop dementia, and how many years in the future dementia may occur."
