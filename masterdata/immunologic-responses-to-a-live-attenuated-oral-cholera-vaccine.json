            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to the cholera vaccine, Vaxchora\u00ae, in healthy subjects.\n\nInvestigators also seek to evaluate additional markers of the adaptive immune response including plasmablasts, activated B cells, memory B cells, and T cell responses in healthy subjects receiving cholera vaccine, produce monoclonal antibodies against cholera, and evaluate the safety and reactogenicity in healthy subjects receiving cholera vaccine.",
            "detailedDescription": "Vibrio cholerae causes an acute diarrheal disease responsible for more than 100,000 deaths and affects an estimated 3 to 5 million people annually. Recent epidemics in Haiti and Africa illustrate the continued reach of this pathogen. Across the globe, one billion people lack access to safe drinking water and are vulnerable to cholera. The increasing disease burden, and emergence of more virulent strains, suggest that more aggressive approaches to preventing cholera are needed. This includes renewed efforts to understand the mechanism of protective immunity against cholera and to improve the protective efficacy of current cholera vaccines.\n\nVaxchora is a live attenuated cholera vaccine that protects against some cholera strains. It has been approved by the FDA since June 2016. Since October, 2016, this vaccine has been recommended for certain travelers 18 through 64 years of age going to cholera-affected areas. The purpose of this study is to look at the immune responses to the FDA approved cholera vaccine (Vaxchora\u00ae).\n\nThis study aims to enroll 50 participants who will receive the Vaxchora live cholera vaccine, of whom 30 will undergo two procedures for small intestinal biopsies: one at screening and the other post vaccination (25 participants at Day 29 and 5 participants at day 90) by an upper endoscopy biopsy (EGD)."
