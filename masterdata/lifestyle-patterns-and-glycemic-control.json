The results from this study has the potential to impact clinical practice and patient care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Variability in lifestyle behaviors has been associated with adverse health, specifically poor glucose control. The project proposes to test whether reducing this variability improves glycemia in patients with pre-diabetes. If successful, this simple positive lifestyle message to keep stable behaviors has the potential to improve the health of millions of adults worldwide.\n\nThis project will enroll participants with pre-diabetes who have erratic lifestyle behaviors and randomize them to either maintain their usual habits (control group) or stabilize their behaviors (stability group). Both groups will be followed for 12 weeks. Before the start of the 12-week period, all participants will track their sleep for 2 weeks and will wear a glucose monitor to measure their glucose levels. At the start and end of the 12-week period, they will come to the research lab to undergo a glucose tolerance test. This test will measure how their body reacts to a glucose load. They will also undergo magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy scanning. This scan will provide information on body composition and liver fat content."
