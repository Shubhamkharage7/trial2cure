            "briefSummary": "The proposed study will evaluate a new approach to cognitive rehabilitation of mTBI using a brain stimulation technique called \"Remotely Supervised Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation combined with Cognitive Training\" (RS-tDCS+) which has shown promise for improving complex attention in both healthy and clinical populations. RS-tDCS+ is a home-based, low-risk, non-invasive technique that is designed to boost cognitive training by enhancing learning and the brain's ability to reorganize connections. This study will evaluate RS-tDCS+ for improving complex attention in Active Duty Service Members (ADSM) and Veterans with a history of mTBI. Different tests of complex attention and symptom questionnaires will be used to determine the effects of real versus sham (placebo) RS-tDCS+. Second, the investigators will investigate electrical and connectivity changes in the brain associated with RS-tDCS+ using electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Third, the investigators will investigate the lasting effects of any observed changes by evaluating participants at 1 and 6 weeks post-treatment. Lastly, the investigators will explore the impact of individual differences (e.g., PTSD, depression, sleep quality, time since injury, baseline impairment, age, sex, ADSM versus Veteran) on treatment outcome.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objectives:\n\nAttention, concentration, and working memory (i.e., complex attention) deficits are the most reported neurocognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and have been associated with patterns of decreased neural activation. Existing cognitive rehabilitation interventions require significant time and effort and are limited by small-to-moderate effect sizes and uncertain durability/generalization of effects. Novel, neuroplasticity-based interventions that improve complex attention and can be administered remotely are needed to increase access to care, decrease recovery time, and improve outcomes and quality of life following mTBI. This multi-site study will investigate remotely-supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) combined with cognitive training in the chronic phase of recovery (\u22653 months) from mTBI to 1) increase accessibility to care, 2) improve cognitive functioning, post-concussion symptom outcomes, and quality of life and 3) investigate the durability of the intervention in Active Duty Service Members (ADSM; at the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) and Veterans (at the Minneapolis VA Health care System (MVAHCS)).\n\nResearch Plan and Methods:\n\nThis is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study. 80 Veterans from the MVAHCS and 80 ADSM from NMCSD (total N=160) will be recruited. Participants will have a history of mTBI and self-reported attention and/or concentration difficulties. Baseline assessment will include self-reported symptoms and objective neurocognitive performance. Resting state functional connectivity changes will be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and oscillatory brain activity will be measured with EEG, both collected at baseline and at post-intervention assessments. Participants will be randomized to either active RS-tDCS or sham RS-tDCS, using stratified randomization by baseline cognitive scores. The intervention sessions will occur in the participant's home, 10 sessions within 2 weeks. Two post-intervention assessments, mirroring the baseline assessment, will occur approximately 1 week and 6 weeks after the intervention. Additionally, the investigators will collect longitudinal real-time data, daily, on TBI symptoms, cognitive, and mood factors during the 6 weeks post-intervention using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).\n\nClinical Relevance:\n\nRS-tDCS+ addresses two major obstacles of current TBI treatments: Accessibility and adherence. RS-tDCS+ offers several benefits as it can be monitored remotely, and can be self-administered in the home after the first session. If RS-tDCS proves effective, this non-invasive intervention could dramatically improve access to a validated treatment that can be rapidly implemented within various DOD and VA settings to reduce TBI-related symptoms, improve cognition, enhance recovery, bolster occupational performance, and improve quality of life."

Specific conditions include (but are not limited to) a history of: brain tumor, epilepsy, cerebral vascular accident (CVA), Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Mania.\n2. History of prior treatment with ECT or neuromodulation in the last 12 months.\n3. Current, diagnosed substance dependence.\n4. Newly prescribed medication within the previous 3 weeks.\n5. Diagnosis of intellectual disability or pervasive developmental disorder (i.e., premorbid IQ less than or equal to 70).\n6. Any medical condition or treatment other than mild TBI (e.g., stroke, tumor, HIV, moderate-severe TBI), with significant neurological disorder or insults that, based on the Principal Investigator's judgment, would impact risk.\n7. Psychosis or mania within 30 days of enrollment, as determined by the PI, based on a psychiatric history and examination and/or a review of available medical records\n8.
