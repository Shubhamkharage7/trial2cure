Part 1 is a weight-based dose escalation following a 3+3 design of dose-escalating cohorts to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Part 2 includes administration at a selected dose and LD regimen. After enrollment, subjects may receive a lymphodepletion therapy regimen before administration of allogeneic CAR-T cells, administered as a single dose. Treated subjects will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response. Rimiducid may be administered."
