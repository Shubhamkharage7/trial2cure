Patients with concomitant second malignancies (except adequately treated non-melanomatous skin cancers, ductal carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, prostate cancer, or in situ cervical cancer) are excluded unless in complete remission two years prior to study entry, and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during study participation.\n2. Patients with any active autoimmune disease or a history of known autoimmune disease, or history of a syndrome that requires systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for patients with vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, or autoimmune thyroid disorders on stable thyroid hormone supplementation.\n3. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy or whose control may be jeopardized by the complications of this therapy. These criteria include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n   1. Uncontrolled airway hyper-reactivity.\n   2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients are allowed if they are under stable glycemic control as per Investigator's assessment.\n   3. Uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease.\n   4.

Uncontrolled hypertension: patients with sustained systolic blood pressure readings greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg should have documentation by the treating physician that the finding is not consistent with uncontrolled hypertension.\n   11. History of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage within one year of dosing on C1D1.\n   12. Poorly controlled seizure disorder.\n   13. Active diverticulitis within one year prior to dosing on C1D1.\n4. Patient requires active systemic anticoagulation at the time of IT injection or biopsy, or with significant bleeding diathesis due to risk of hematoma at the injection site. Patients on anticoagulant agents require consultation with the sponsor prior to enrollment.\n5. Risk of vascular catastrophe.\n6. Treatment with systemic antiviral, antibacterial or antifungal agents for acute infection within \u2264 7 days of dosing on C1D1.\n7.

Male patient who plans to father a child or donate sperm within 120 days or 5 half-lives of CLN-617 whichever comes later, of last study drug administration, or who has a partner who is a FOCBP, and declines to use an acceptable method to prevent pregnancy during study treatment and for 120 days or 5 half-lives of CLN-617, whichever comes later, after the last dose of study drug administration.",
