            "detailedDescription": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a hot trend in weight-loss diets. TRE can reduce cardio-metabolic risks, thereby lowering body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose, and inflammation. The most effective way for the overweight population to improve body composition is to incorporate TRE with exercise. However, there were only two TRE interventions in humans that included exercise, suggesting that the additive effect of TRE to exercise may be dependent on dietary timing. TRE can be divided into early TRE (eTRE) and late TRE (lTRE), depending on the time of day of the eating window. However, whether different TRE schedules with exercise can improve cardio-metabolic health is questionable. There have been no interventions of different TRE schedules with exercise. This study will be beneficial for determining which TRE schedule with exercise is efficacious to prevent cardio-metabolic disease."
