The fasting mimicking diet will be consumed for 5 days per month for a total of 6 months and will be monitored by trained research dietitians.\n\nThis study aims to examine the effects of a fasting mimicking diet (5 days per month eating L-Nutra products only for 6 months) vs. usual diet on response to cancer treatment of metastatic castrate sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma."
