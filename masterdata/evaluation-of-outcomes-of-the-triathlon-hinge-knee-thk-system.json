            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Triathlon Hinge Knee System for both primary and revision cases in accordance with the Indications for Use.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to determine (1) mid- (5 year) and long-term (10 year) survivorship, and (2) drivers of failure for the THK hinge. Data from this study will be used to develop a predictive model to identify the most important factors in achieving fixation, including the role of augments, cones, thresholds for cement mantle thickness, and number of zones of fixation required for survivorship.\n\nSurvivorship is defined as the absence of aseptic revision to the implanted device.\n\nThe Triathlon Hinge Knee System consists of Triathlon Hinge femoral components, the Triathlon Revision baseplate, Triathlon Revision Tibial Augments, Triathlon Hinge Femoral Distal Augments, Triathlon Hinge Insert, Triathlon Revision Insert X3, and Triathlon Hinge Bumpers, Axle, Bushings, Tibial Sleeve, and Bearing component.\n\nIt is designed to be a single platform for revision, difficult primary, and limb salvage surgeries."
