            "detailedDescription": "Systemic amyloidosis is an incurable disease, and about 20% of patients with cardiac or advanced kidney involvement experience early deaths (\\<1 year). Despite recent progress in proteasome inhibitors, chemotherapies, and immunotherapies that target plasma cells have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with systemic amyloidosis, median survival remains low at approximately five years.\n\nAT-02 (INN: not yet available) is a full-length, humanized, recombinant immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1)-like glycoprotein monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is being developed to treat systemic amyloidosis.\n\nThis is a three-part, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of rising single doses of AT-02 in healthy volunteers (HV) and in subjects with systemic amyloidosis (SA) and to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses of AT-02 in subjects with systemic amyloidosis.\n\nPart 1 is a double-blind, single-center, single-ascending dose escalation study in HV to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of AT-02. Healthy volunteers between 18 to 56 years of will be enrolled in the Part 1 study.\n\nPart 2 is an open-label, single-ascending dose escalation study in subjects with systemic amyloidosis to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of AT-02 and to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects with SA over 18 years of age will be involved in the Part 2 study.\n\nPart 3 is an open-label, multiple-ascending dose, dose escalation study in subjects with systemic amyloidosis to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity of multiple doses of AT-02. Subjects with SA \u226518 and \u226485 years of age will be involved in the Part 3 study."
