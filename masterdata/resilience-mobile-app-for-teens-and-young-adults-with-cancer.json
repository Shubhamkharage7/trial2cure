The use of mobile applications for psychosocial symptom self-management is appealing to this demographic population but this has not yet been developed and tested.\n\nPRISM is a novel, brief, evidence-based 1:1 intervention that teaches stress management, goal-setting, meaning making, cognitive-behavioral, and mindfulness strategies. Here, we propose to test a mobile health (mHealth) version of PRISM, mPRISM. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and exploratory efficacy of mPRISM using a waitlist control design."
