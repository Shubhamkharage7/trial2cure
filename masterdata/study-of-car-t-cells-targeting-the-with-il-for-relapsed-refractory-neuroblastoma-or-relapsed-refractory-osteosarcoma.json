            "briefSummary": "The body has different ways of fighting infections and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are molecules that fight infections and protect your body from diseases caused by bacteria and toxic substances. Antibodies work by sticking to those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been enough to cure most patients.\n\nThis multicenter study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells (CAR) cells targeted against the disialoganglioside (GD2) antigen that express Interleukin (IL)-15, and the inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9), also known as iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "In previous studies, it has been shown that when T cells have part of an antibody attached to them, they are better at recognizing and killing cancer cells. The antibody that will be used in this study is called anti-GD2. This antibody floats around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called neuroblastoma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called GD2. For this study, the anti-GD2 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating freely in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. However, it is unknown how long the iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells last in the body, so their chances of fighting cancer cells are not well known.\n\nTo improve the tumor-fighting power of GD2-CAR-T cells, two additional components were added to these cells. The IL-15 gene was added so that the GD2-CAR-T cells can attack tumor cells more effectively. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a chemical that cells use to communicate with one another. Other research using IL-15 in combination with CAR-T cells has shown there is an increase in the body's ability to allow the CAR-T cells to survive and grow in the body. The iC9 gene was added as an \"off switch\" so it can stop the activity of the GD2-CAR-T cells if there are any serious bad side effects. Bad side effects seen previously in patients receiving the GD2 antibody alone include pain. In this study, the \"stop switch\" can be used to turn off the GD2-CAR-T cells if you experience intense pain that does not respond to normal pain treatments.\n\nThe study will enroll a minimum of 10 adult subjects and 10 pediatric subjects; all subjects will undergo lymphodepletion chemotherapy prior to the cell infusion as outlined in the protocol."
