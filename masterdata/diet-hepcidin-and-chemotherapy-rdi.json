Associations between hepcidin concentration and relative dose intensity (RDI) of chemotherapy will also be evaluated.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, observational cohort of 100 women receiving chemotherapy for breast or gynecological cancer at GW Cancer Center from July 1, 2024 - approximately September 2025. At study baseline (after diagnosis, but prior to starting chemotherapy), participants will complete a \\~30-minute food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and demographic/food security survey using a preprogrammed iPad in the clinic. The clinical research nurse will obtain an additional research blood draw at the same time as the patient's routine clinical blood draw prior to chemotherapy initiation for serum hepcidin concentration measurement. Data on cancer type, premorbid medical conditions, and chemotherapy plans and administration will be collected from the electronic health record by study staff and the duration of data collection will be the length of chemotherapy plus 30 days. Data will be used to address the objectives below.\n\nAmong adult women scheduled to receive chemotherapy for breast or gynecological cancer treatment, the objectives/aims of this study will be to:\n\n1. Determine the extent to which pretreatment, self-reported Dietary Inflammatory Index dietary pattern scores from dietary intake during the one month prior to chemotherapy initiation are associated with pretreatment serum hepcidin concentrations\n2. Determine the extent to which pretreatment serum hepcidin concentrations are associated with chemotherapy RDI."
