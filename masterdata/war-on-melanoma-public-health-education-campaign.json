            "briefSummary": "This trial studies how well a health educational campaign works in increasing early detection of melanoma in Oregon. The health educational campaign may provide information to help people learn about the early signs of melanoma. Increased education in Oregon may decrease the number of people who die from melanoma and increase the number of melanomas that are identified at an earlier stage.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To measure the change in melanoma literacy in Oregon, Washington, and Utah over five years (relative to baseline) and determine if there is a statistically significant difference in literacy in Oregon (where the educational campaign occurred) as compared to the non-participating states (Washington and Utah).\n\nII. To determine if there is an association between melanoma literacy and 1) stage at diagnosis, 2) tumor depth, 3) incidence, and 4) mortality rates in Oregon, Washington, and Utah.\n\nIII. To determine if the cost of care for melanoma in Oregon is impacted by melanoma literacy and/or tumor stage.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nMEDIA CAMPAIGN: Participants view digital media strategies.\n\nPRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND PROFESSIONALS: Primary care providers and professionals who see skin and potential melanomas receive online based curriculum on melanoma. Participants also complete a survey to assess knowledge and confidence before and after receiving the curriculum.\n\nMELANOMA COMMUNITY REGISTRY VOLUNTEERS: Melanoma Community Registry volunteers in Oregon receive educational and training materials on melanoma. Participants also complete a survey before and after receiving educational material.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: High school students receive an educational lecture over 1 hour on sun-safety and early detection of melanoma practices. Participants also complete a survey before and after the educational lecture."
