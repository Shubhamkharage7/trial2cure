The primary hypothesis (Part 1) is that at a generally well tolerated dose level, the true geometric mean concentration at Day 85 of MK-2214 in cerebrospinal fluid is \\>0.3 nanomolar (nM). Optional healthy older participants (Part 2) may receive MK-2214 at dose levels determined by criteria met in Part 1."
