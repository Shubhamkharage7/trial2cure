            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of sacituzumab govitecan with trastuzumab (Herceptin, Herceptin Hylecta, or trastuzumab biosimilar) in metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. Participants may receive a biosimilar drug to trastuzumab, which is a nearly identical \"copycat\" of an original drug that is manufactured by a different company\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan for Human-epidermal growth receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer, but it has been approved for triple negative breast cancer and hormone receptor positive but HER2-negative breast cancer.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has approved Trastuzumab to be administered as an IV (intravenous) or subcutaneous (injection under the skin) for HER2+ breast cancer.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, blood tests, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, biopsies, study treatment visits, echocardiograms and/or Multigated Acquisition (MUGA) scans.\n\nIt is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc. is supporting this research study by providing funding for the trial as well as one of the study drugs, sacituzumab govitecan."

Patients without pathologic or cytologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation.\n* At least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by CT (MRI where CT is contraindicated) and is suitable for repeated assessment as per RECIST 1.149 (see Section 11).\n\nNOTE: If the only site of measurable of disease has been previously irradiated, there must be evidence of post-radiation progression.\n\n* Either the primary tumor or the metastasis (or both) must be HER2+ per ASCO/CAP 2018 guidelines.1 Central confirmation of HER2 status is not required.\n* Any ER and PR expression are permitted but must be known.\n* Participants must have received prior treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab, and T-DXd. These agents may have been administered in the curative or the advanced setting. Prior progression on these agents is not required. T-DXd does not need to be the most recent prior therapy.\n* Participants must have discontinued all chemotherapy, biologic treatment or investigational agent at least 14 days prior to study treatment initiation (any prior endocrine therapy does not require washout).\n* All toxicities related to prior chemotherapy must have resolved to CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 or lower, except alopecia can be any grade and neuropathy can be grade 2 or lower.\n* Participants on bisphosphonates or RANK ligand inhibitors may continue receiving therapy during study treatment and also may initiate therapy with these agents on study if clinically indicated.\n* Prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 7 days prior to study treatment initiation, and all toxicities related to prior radiation therapy must have resolved to CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 or lower, unless otherwise specified in 3.1.14.\n* Previously treated brain metastases are permitted, with the following provisions: (1) Prior SRS should be completed \u2265 7 days before study treatment initiation; (2) Prior WBRT should be completed \u2265 7 days before study treatment initiation.

Childbearing potential is defined as participants who have not reached a postmenopausal state (\u2265 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause) and have not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).\n* WOCBP must agree to use an adequate method of contraception. Contraception is required starting with the first dose of study medication through 7 months after the last dose of study medication. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception (Appendix C).\n* Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of study treatment 7 months after the last dose of study treatment.\n* Participants must be willing to undergo a research biopsy at baseline. If disease is not safely accessible according to the treating investigator, permission to waive the mandatory baseline biopsy must be received from the sponsor-investigator. Patients must be willing to provide archival tissue for research purposes.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior therapy with any Trop-2 directed ADC, including sacituzumab govitecan.\n* Prior hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, sacituzumab govitecan, or the excipients of trastuzumab or sacituzumab govitecan.\n* Known history of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) \\*28 allele homozygosity, which is associated with increased risk for neutropenia and diarrhea related to irinotecan.50 UGT1A1 genotyping is not required for eligibility.\n\nNote: Concurrent administration of strong UGT1A1 inhibitors or inducers is not allowed during the study (See Section 5.5).\n\n* Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require corticosteroid therapy to control symptoms.\n* Known leptomeningeal disease.\n* Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation. Patients must have recovered from any effects of any recent major surgery.\n* Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances:\n\n  * Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.\n  * Individuals with the following cancers that have been diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years are eligible: cervical/prostate carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, non-melanoma cancer of the skin.\n  * Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 3 years and felt to be at low\n  * risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study principal investigator to determine eligibility.\n* Uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease, uncontrolled seizures, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Participants who are pregnant or breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.",
