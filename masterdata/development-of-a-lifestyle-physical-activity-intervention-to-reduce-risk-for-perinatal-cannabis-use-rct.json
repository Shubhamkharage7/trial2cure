Similar to our prior trials with pregnant women, the intervention period will be 12 weeks in duration during pregnancy, with follow-ups extending to the end of pregnancy and into the postpartum period. Major assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and 4 weeks postpartum; we will also conduct brief phone surveys at three points in between the larger assessments. Participants will complete a 7-day period of accelerometry and urine toxicology screens following each major assessments. Birth record abstractions to collect information about specific outcomes (pre-term delivery, low birth weight) will be conducted by trained staff at one month post-birth."
