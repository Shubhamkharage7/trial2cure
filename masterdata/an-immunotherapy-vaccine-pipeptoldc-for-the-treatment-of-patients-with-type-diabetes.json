            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects of PIpepTolDC vaccine in treating patients with type 1 diabetes who use insulin and don't have any other diabetes-related health complications. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system, which usually protects against foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, attacks the body's insulin-producing betacells in the pancreas (autoimmune response). Overtime, the beta cells are destroyed by the immune system. To stay alive, people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin. PIpepTolDC vaccine is a type of immunotherapy (a treatment that uses a person's own immune system) that works like an allergy shot. The vaccine is made using one's own immune cells (dendritic cells) and a beta cell protein. The vaccine may teach the immune system to stop attacking the beta cells, which may help the beta cells recover and make enough insulin to control blood sugar levels. The vaccine may also help reduce future type 1 diabetes related complications."
