Any contraindication or a medication or supplement known to severely interact with the standard antimicrobial regimen (SAR) as detailed in the US Prescribing Information (USPI) or Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of fluconazole, posaconazole, or TMP/SMX.\n16. Known hypersensitivity to Rezafungin for Injection, any echinocandin, fluconazole, posaconazole, other azole antifungal, or to any of their excipients.\n17. Known hypersensitivity or inability to receive TMP/SMX or any of its excipients, including but not limited to anaphylaxis, exfoliative skin disorders, or acute porphyria.\n18. Recent use of an investigational medicinal product within 28 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational medicinal product, whichever is greater, to prevent overlapping toxicities when this study's investigational product is dosed, or presence of an investigational device at the time of screening.

Subjects with unknown HIV status should be tested for HIV antibodies per standard of care.\n20. Pregnant or lactating females.\n21. The Principal Investigator (PI) determines that the subject should not participate in the study.\n22.
