Conventionally, rTMS investigations have relied on rational decision trees for dosage determination. The purpose of this study is to systematically examine an accelerated protocol of intermittent theta burst (iTBS). Study 1 aims to provide a quantifiable dose-response curve for iTBS and depressive symptom reduction in major depression. Study 2 aims to determine the role of individual variations of their functional networks compared to the site of stimulation and clinical outcomes."
