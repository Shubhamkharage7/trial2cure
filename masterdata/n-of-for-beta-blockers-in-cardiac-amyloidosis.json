To achieve this objective, 20 N-of-1 trials (on vs. off) will be conducted, and the study team will subsequently interview participants to better understand their outcomes. Each subject will participate in 2 periods lasting between up to 6 weeks each based on each patient's health profile. We will also engage stakeholders to understand the acceptability and feasibility of deprescribing N-of-1 trials. The N-of-1 trials will be iteratively refined in real-time based on feedback.",

During the On (A) period, subjects will be on their beta-blocker, previously prescribed to the subjects by their physician. During the Off (B) period, their beta-blockers will be down-titrated and subsequently discontinued; we will decrease the dose of beta-blocker by 50% every week regardless of which beta-blocker they are on, similar to an algorithm used in a prior deprescribing trial."
