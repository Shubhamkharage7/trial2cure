            "briefSummary": "Exercise is considered the most effective, non-drug treatment for reducing pain and improving movement in patients with osteoarthritis. Diminished muscle strength is a common symptom associated with the onset of knee osteoarthritis. The evidence supports the benefit of exercise therapy, in reducing pain and improving function in subjects with knee OA, however research to date has been unable to quantify the disease-modifying effect of any form of exercise. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate how the use of a seated compact elliptical machine (Cubii JR1) exercise program in conjunction with a standard physical therapy regimen will impact the health of individuals with knee osteoarthritis.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate how the use of a seated compact elliptical machine (Cubii JR1) exercise program in conjunction with a standard physical therapy regimen will impact the health of individuals with knee osteoarthritis. This includes a range of motion of the knee and ankle, level of pain as measured using a standard questionnaire, muscle strength as well as satisfaction scores with this device. This study will contain two groups: A control group receiving a standard physical therapy exercise program instruction, and a treatment group that will receive standard physical therapy exercise program instruction in conjunction with a home exercise program using a seated compact elliptical machine (Cubii JR1).\n\nHypothesis: The hypothesis is that subjects with knee osteoarthritis who use the at-home seated compact elliptical trainer for a minimum of 30-minutes per day in conjunction with standard physical therapy program instruction will have a greater reduction in pain, increased range of motion at the knee, and ankle joint, increase in quality of life and greater quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength than those who receive just the standard physical therapy program instruction."

The instrument consists of two components: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).The first part consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five response categories (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems), from which a single EQ-5D index score can be calculated ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health). The EQ-VAS measures one's self-perceived health today on a vertical scale from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health) on which participants have to indicate their current health.",
