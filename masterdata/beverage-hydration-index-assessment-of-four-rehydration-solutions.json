            "briefSummary": "No studies to date to evaluate the effects of the three different liquid IV electrolyte products on the beverage hydration index (BHI). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of three different LIV products (Hydration multiplier, Sugar Free formulation with Amino Acids, and Sugar Free with allulose) on hydration status in young and active men and women compared to a control (water). The study will follow the same approach as used by Maughan and colleagues (2016) to measure the fluid balance (the difference between the amount of water consumed and passed as urine) and BHI (the relative amount of urine passed after consumption of a drink compared to water) including time in positive fluid balance, as well as determining electrolyte concentrations, osmolality, specific gravity, and sodium and potassium in urine.",
            "detailedDescription": "Many attempts have been made to improve and measure the hydration status of active individuals. This typically involves the ingestion of fluids leading up to activity (typically plain water), as well as the ingestion of fluids during the activity itself (water, along with a diluted carbohydrate/electrolyte beverage). This approach seems to work well; however, some debate remains over what the best fluid is to consume, in particular related to the macronutrient type and the specific electrolyte mix.\n\nNo studies to date to evaluate the effects of the three different liquid IV electrolyte products on the beverage hydration index (BHI).
