When people have lost sensation in their feet, it may make walking and balance more difficult. The Somatosensation Device is designed to substitute the loss of feeling in a foot by pressing on nerves on the surface of the leg. It presses on the nerves by using a pneumatic balloon to put pressure on your skin. If people receive this extra sensation feedback, it may help improve their walking and balance."
