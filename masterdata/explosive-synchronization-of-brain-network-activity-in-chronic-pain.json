            "briefSummary": "This project is being conducted to evaluate the impact of explosive synchronization (ES) and its treatment with non-invasive brain stimulation in fibromyalgia (FM). The study design has three components, however, only 2 aims are enrolling participants. The first part (Aim1) is a cross sectional assessment of brain network explosive synchronization activity, connectivity, and response to pain in healthy controls and age and sex-matched fibromyalgia patients; the third part (Aim 3) is a longitudinal assessment of fibromyalgia patients undergoing one week of sham followed by high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) of the motor cortex (M1) or one week of ES HD-tDCS of a brain region identified from computer modelling (Aim 2).",
            "detailedDescription": "In the first part healthy controls (25 female/10 males) and fibromyalgia (25 female/10 males) participants that are enrolled in this phase will have 3 visits as well as a run-in observational period (up to a total of 33 days). During this time, participants will complete surveys, as well as have electroencephalograms (EEG) with quantitative sensory testing and functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nHypothesis: FM patients will display greater ES in the brain, compared to pain-free controls when assessed with EEG at rest. Furthermore, patients experiencing increased clinical pain, will display increases in ES metrics\n\nIn the third part FM patients will be enrolled (50) and receive treatment with either sham treatment followed by M1 HD-tDCS or sham treatment followed by ES HD-tDCS. These participants will also complete surveys and have neuroimaging EEG/MRI.\n\nHypothesis: Following a course of HD-tDCS targeted at either A.) the motor cortex (M1) or B.) an ES-sensitive region identified in Aim 2, FM patients will display decreased strength of ES conditions (correlation between node degree and frequency) as compared to Sham, when assessed with EEG. Moreover, the degree of pain reduction following HD-tDCS will correlate with the amount of reduction in these network parameters leading to ES. If unable to identify an ES-sensitive region using computer modeling in Aim 2, our hypothesis for motor cortex stimulation is that HD-tDCS at M1 will result in decreased ES conditions as compared to Sham, when assessed with EEG."
