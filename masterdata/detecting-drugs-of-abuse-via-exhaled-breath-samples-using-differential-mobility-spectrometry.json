            "briefSummary": "This Phase II STTR program consists of two major goals within the overarching goal of developing and validating a proprietary device (BID2) for marijuana and opioid detection in breath samples.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is intended to lead to the development and demonstration of a breathalyzer instrument capable of detecting and quantitatively measuring drugs (i.e. cannabinoids and opioids) in exhaled breath (EB). Prior work on the detection of these drugs in EB by means of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) demonstrated that these compounds can be quantitatively detected, but LC/MS is slow, expensive and requires highly skilled personnel to implement. What is needed is a simple and inexpensive method for rapidly measuring the amount of drugs in EB.\n\nIf such a method becomes available it can be used by law enforcement and in doctors' offices, hospital emergency rooms, ambulances and other government agencies, military bases and companies seeking to screen employees for drug abuse. Vox Biomedical proposes to develop a method for quantitatively detecting the presence of drugs in EB by means of Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) developed at Draper Laboratories. DMS is a robust, datarich, ultra-trace, chemical detection technology that has been proven for numerous applications including air quality cabin monitoring on the International Space Station (ISS), chemical warfare agent detection, explosives detection, and drinking water analysis. Recently Draper has applied this device to breath analysis for the detection of lung diseases.\n\nA clinical study is currently underway and initial results are promising. This project involves transferring this technology developed by Draper for lung infection detection to the detection of psychoactive drugs in exhaled breath. Phase I of the proposed program will investigate the DMS signatures of cannabinoids in the laboratory and defining the device's limits of detection. A small pilot study will also be performed to demonstrate feasibility for using breath analysis as a proxy for the concentration of cannabinoids in the blood."

Unlike gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS) systems that are large and expensive, DMS is small, portable (approximately the size of a shoe box) and is able to measure the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOC) at parts per trillion (ppt) detection levels. The participant will exhale into the device via a plastic tube and the breath sample will be analyzed in situ.
