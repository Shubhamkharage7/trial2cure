            "briefSummary": "This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare cancer control and health-related quality of life following pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy versus standard radical prostatectomy.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy will have similar cancer control (primary outcome) and sexual function outcomes; and significantly better urinary function, penile shortening/deformity and inguinal hernia risks as compared to radical prostatectomy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Traditional radical prostatectomy is the most popular treatment for clinically significant prostate cancer, however significant risks including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, penile shortening, penile curvature/ deformation (Peyronie's disease), and inguinal hernia, are common. Pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy is a new surgical technique that may preserve fascial support structures, arterial supply to the penis, and nerves that are severed and resected during conventional radical prostatectomy.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Subjects will be randomized to receive either radical prostatectomy or pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy. Investigators will compare cancer control and health-related quality of life outcomes through patient questionnaires and medical record review."
