The purpose of such a protocol is that frequently patients are referred to us with either diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses which would be of interest to our teaching program or which would serve as a source of patients to subsequently be entered into established, ongoing protocol studies. Such patients will be admitted to the protocol and handled according to accepted medical practice of diagnosis and treatment.",

Once diagnosis is made patients are referred to relevant NIH protocols for follow-up. If an NIH protocol does not exist for the condition, participants receive the required clinical standard of care treatment through an outside provider or through this protocol if a provider with the necessary expertise cannot be found. It is a minimal risk study.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo evaluate patients with possible infectious and/or inflammatory diseases in order to collect data/samples through the diagnosis of infectious and inflammatory conditions (including in terms of clinical, immunologic, and metabolic features) further characterize, and treat infectious and inflammatory conditions through the collection of clinical specimens, medical records and in-person assessments\n\nTo provide a repository of information on enrolled participants to allow for hypothesis generation in future research"
