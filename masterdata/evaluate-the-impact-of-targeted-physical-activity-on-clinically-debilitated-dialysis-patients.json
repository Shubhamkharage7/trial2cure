Randomization will be a 2:1 ratio (100 intervention, 50 control). The intervention arm will perform a 12-month exercise intervention which involves two days a week of personalized exercise rehabilitation. The control arm will receive no exercise intervention. Both arms of patients will be tested on various measures of health and function both at baseline (prior to intervention) at 6 months, and at 12 months (post intervention). This study will also investigate the effects of an exercise intervention on a subgroup of pre- and post- kidney transplant patients (PPKT Subgroup). This subgroup will include a total of 100 patients (\u2265 18 years of age), who are on dialysis, or have CKD stage 4 or 5, and are considered clinically debilitated by their direct healthcare professional will be enrolled, or post- renal (kidney) transplant. This subgroup will perform 36 visits of exercise intervention which involves two days a week of personalized exercise rehabilitation. The Investigator will also utilize validated surveys and assessment tools to assess health issue management and depression severity."
