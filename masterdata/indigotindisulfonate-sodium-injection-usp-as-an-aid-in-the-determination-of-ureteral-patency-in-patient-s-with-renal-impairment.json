            "detailedDescription": "An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline will be determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and standardized by using individual's body surface area as described in the FDA's Renal Impairment guidance. Qualified subjects/patients will be stratified into 4 cohorts based on their eGFR at baseline: patients with normal renal function (eGFR \u2265 90 mL/min), patients with mild (eGFR 60-89 mL/min), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min) and severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min) renal impairment.\n\nUp to ten study centers in the United States will enroll up to approximately 12 subjects per cohort (48 subjects in total) scheduled for a surgical procedure in which the patency of the ureter must be assessed by cystoscopy following the procedure, age 18 to 85 years inclusive covering the full renal function range from normal, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. For each subject/patient the study will consist of a screening period (Day -30 to Day -2), a baseline evaluation (Day -1 to Day 1) and a single treatment period (Day 1) with an onsite observation period of 24 hours post-dose. After signing the informed consent, review of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed, the collection of concomitant medications, medical history, physical examination, baseline laboratory testing, 12-lead ECG, and vital sign measurements will be completed during the screening visit.\n\nOn the day of surgery (Day 1) subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for randomization. Eligible subjects will be stratified by cohort and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a dose of either Bludigo\u2122 high dose (5.0 mL) or Bludigo\u2122 low dose (2.5 mL). All randomized subjects will serve as his/her own control (i.e., intra-patient controlled) for efficacy by receiving a dose of normal saline prior to receiving the randomized Bludigo\u2122 dose. The surgeon will be blinded to the Bludigo\u2122 dose a subject receives. Time of injection of saline and Bludigo\u2122 will be captured.\n\nAll treated subjects will have a follow-up visit 7 to 30 days (\u00b1 2 days) after the procedure. A final telephone follow-up call will occur on Day 30 (\u00b1 2 days) in subjects who have the follow-up visit before Day 28.\n\nSafety assessments will include monitoring of AEs during and post the procedure, clinical laboratory tests, 12-Lead ECG, and vital sign measurements."
