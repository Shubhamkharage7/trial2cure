            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nLung cancers with EGFR mutations may develop resistance to therapies targeting this protein by evolving/being transformed into small cell or neuroendocrine cancers. There are no standard treatments for it. Researchers want to see if a new combination of drugs can help.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if the combination of durvalumab and olaparib will cause tumors to shrink.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults age 18 and older who had EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that was treated and now transformed to SCLC or another neuroendocrine tumor.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under a separate protocol. They may have a tumor biopsy.\n\nParticipants will have a physical exam. They will have a review of their symptoms, their medicines, and their ability to do their normal activities. They will have blood tests. They will have an electrocardiogram to evaluate their heart.\n\nParticipants will have a computed tomography (CT) scan, a series of x-rays taken of parts of the body.\n\nParticipants will get durvalumab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. It is given through a small plastic tube that is put in an arm vein. They will take olaparib by mouth twice every day. They will keep a medicine diary.\n\nParticipants will take the study drugs until their disease gets worse or they have unacceptable side effects.\n\nAbout 30 days after they stop taking the study drugs, participants will have a follow-up visit. Then they will be contacted every 6 months for the rest of their life....",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nTargeted therapies designed for specific genetic alterations, known as cancer driver mutations, have changed the treatment paradigm in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in NSCLC with activating mutation in the EGFR. Although most patients achieve robust responses to EGFR TKIs with tumor shrinkage and symptomatic relief, drug resistance eventually develops in the majority of patients.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation has been reported as one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\n\nSeveral phase III trials showed durable response with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the breast and ovarian cancer with BRCA mutation, a tumor suppressor gene involving homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and several PARP inhibitors are now FDA approved for these cancers.\n\nImmune checkpoint blockade appears to be most effective against hypermutated tumors, suggesting that clinical responses correlate with an increased propensity to produce neoantigens.\n\nEGFR-mutated transformed SCLC is an aggressive cancer whose clinical course is similar to that of SCLC. There are no standard treatments for this disease and prospective studies have not been conducted to date. Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone are not effective for EGFR-mutated transformed SCLC. Analyses of EGFR transformed SCLC tumors suggest that these tumors are HRR deficient.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo assess the efficacy of a combination of durvalumab and olaparib with respect to best overall response (BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC and other neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nEligibility:\n\nSubjects with initial diagnosis of EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nSubjects should have received platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy for small cell/neuroendocrine transformation or refused such therapy.\n\nAge \\>=18 years.\n\nSubjects must have measurable disease.\n\nECOG performance status \\<= 2\n\nAdequate organ function\n\nDesign:\n\n-This is an open label Phase II study evaluating the combination of durvalumab and olaparib\n\nin participants with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following\n\ntreatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nPatients will be treated with durvalumab (1,500 mg), IV, every 28 days and olaparib (300\n\nmg BID for total daily dose of 600 mg) in a 28-day cycles.\n\nPatients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAE v5.0, and for response every 8 (+/-1) weeks by RECIST 1.1\n\nTreatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."

Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[anti-HBc\\] and absence of HBsAg) and patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HBV or HCV RNA..\n* HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions with study drugs.
