This represents a less restrictive metabolic intervention compared to a strict ketogenic diet while replicating two foundational elements of the ketogenic diet: low levels of glycemic/insulin signaling and high levels of circulating ketones. In addition to assessments of mood stability and global functioning, functional neuroimaging data will be obtained to better characterize the biomechanistic effects of this intervention."
