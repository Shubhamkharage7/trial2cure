Tumors shed DNA and other cancer related chemicals into the blood that can be identified and studied further to provide information about the cancer. Information gathered from this study may help researchers better understand if ctDNA found in the blood can predict whether colorectal cancer may come back or spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Demonstrate ability to monitor cancer-specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and proteomic alterations from plasma.\n\nII. Improve detection of recurrences post completion of curative therapies through monitoring of plasma cancer-specific DNA, RNA and proteomic alterations.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Qualitative and quantitative changes in cancer-specific plasma alterations during neoadjuvant, adjuvant therapies and surveillance.\n\nII. Disease free survival (DFS) of patients with detectable cancer-specific plasma alterations.\n\nIII. Overall survival (OS) of patients with detectable cancer-specific plasma alterations.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Optimal combination of cancer-specific plasma DNA, RNA and / or proteomic alterations for early detection of recurrences.\n\nII. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of cancer-specific plasma alterations in detecting recurrences.\n\nIII. Correlation between cancer-specific alterations in plasma and tissue and either with outcomes including DFS \\& OS.\n\nIV. Nature and frequency of detection of incidental non-colorectal cancer related DNA, RNA and / or proteomic alterations.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline, during each neoadjuvant therapy treatment, prior to surgical resection, and up to 4 times per year for up to 5 years. Patients also undergo collection of tissue sample at time of surgical resection. Patients' medical records may also be reviewed."
