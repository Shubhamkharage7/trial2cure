            "briefSummary": "The study hypothesis is that participants enrolled in a virtual Takotsubo support group will have significantly less anxiety at one year.",
            "detailedDescription": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, sometimes termed Takotsubo syndrome and \"broken heart syndrome,\" typically presents with symptoms remarkably similar to acute myocardial infarction (MI; heart attack): debilitating chest pain, shortness of breath, and a feeling of doom, among others. Takotsubo was first identified in 1990 in Japan. Most cases occur in older women. During the acute phase, the heart spontaneously undergoes \"apical ballooning,\" changing shape to resemble a \"takotsubo,\" a Japanese octopus trap. In approximately two-thirds of cases, Takotsubo is precipitated by an intense emotional or physical \"trigger.\" Typically, the heart spontaneously reverts to its previous shape within about a month. Initially, it was thought that recurrence was rare. However, more recently, recurrences have been reported in 3-15% of cases. Many patients experience a variety of debilitating cardiac and psychological symptoms long after the initial presentation. There is no known way to prevent a recurrent event and patients are typically anxious about the possibility.\n\nSince its inception as a diagnosis, one of the hallmarks of Takotsubo has been the absence of coronary artery plaque. In a surprising finding from 2019, a study of more than 1,000 Takotsubo patients undergoing coronary angiography reported that approximately 1/3 of patients had clinically significant plaque in their coronary arteries; 1/3 had evidence of sub-clinical atherosclerosis; and 1/3 had \"clean coronaries,\" with no observable plaque. Hence, much needs to be learned about this syndrome that may affect as many as 5% of women who have been diagnosed with acute MI. Takotsubo is typically an emotionally challenging and life altering event. Strategies for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease will be discussed in the virtual group sessions.\n\nCurrently, there is no specialized intervention for patients diagnosed with Takotsubo Syndrome at Weill Cornell Medical Center, either in hospital or after discharge."
