            "briefSummary": "Older adults with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk for severe hypoglycemia and its related complications (including hospitalization and death) when taking insulin. This study proposes to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial, a strategy of safe insulin prescribing based on an educational program that leverages continuous glucose monitoring to support older adults at high risk for hypoglycemia. If the aims of this project are achieved, this novel care strategy could be widely applied to reduce severe hypoglycemia episodes in older, high-risk adults with type 2 diabetes.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of this pragmatic randomized clinical trial is to support safer diabetes care in older adults (age \u2265 75) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who require insulin therapy. Many of these older adults are at high risk for severe hypoglycemia due to symptom unawareness and/or nocturnal hypoglycemia. Effective and safe management in this population requires close glucose monitoring coupled with proactive medication and diet adjustment to avoid severe iatrogenic consequences. This study proposes to achieve this goal through a patient-oriented intervention program that incorporates the use of alarm-enabled continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). There are currently no major randomized trials directly assessing the use of CGM to reduce severe hypoglycemia among the oldest adults with T2D. The study team will conduct a 3-arm trial: 1) Group-based, three-session education intervention (CGM provided to participants), 2) Group-based, three-session education intervention (CGM provided to participants) plus 1:1 consultation with a diabetes pharmacist, and 3) usual care (no CGM provided to participants). The primary outcome is an aggregate measure of clinically significant hypoglycemia. The study will also examine differences in patient-reported diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycemia, and self-efficacy using validated survey measures."
