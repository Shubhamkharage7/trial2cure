The Phase 1b dose escalation study designed to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacologically active doses/ maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose of AsiDNA in combination with olaparib.\n\nOnce the RP2D has been determined the Phase 2 study will proceed evaluating AsiDNA in combination with olaparib in participants with recurrent ovarian cancer, recurrent breast cancer and recurrent CRPC that failed or progressed on PARP inhibitors (PARPi) therapy. The objective of Phase 2 study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy as measured by ORR of AsiDNA in combination with olaparib in each of the three cohorts. Eligible participants will be included to receive AsiDNA by IV infusion in addition to olaparib."

Surgically (bilateral orchiectomy) or medically castrated, with serum testosterone\n\n     * 50 ng/dL (\u22641.73 nmol/L) at screening. v. Medically castrated participants must be willing to continue gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or antagonist for the duration of study treatment.\n5. All participants in Phase 2 must have documented progression (clinical or radiographic) on PARPi.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any systemic anti-tumor-directed drug therapy within 28 days or 5 times the elimination half life (whichever is shorter) before study treatment, except for PARPi.\n2. Treatment with investigational drugs within 28 days before first study drug administration.\n3. Radical radiation therapy within four weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment or received local palliative radiation therapy for bone metastases within two weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n4. Concomitant use of known strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors (eg, itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is two weeks.\n5. Concomitant use of known strong (eg, phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (eg, bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is five weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and three weeks for other agents.\n6. Other malignancy within the last 5 years except curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and in situ breast cancer.\n7. Participant has a condition which precludes the swallowing or absorption of an oral medication.\n8. Participants with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable and are on stable or tapering doses of steroids for at least 7 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n9.
