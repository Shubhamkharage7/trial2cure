Most participants experience at least mild decreases in their memory or attention after radiation therapy. Investigators hope that PET scans, lumbar puncture, and blood tests might help investigators predict who might have larger changes in their brain function after radiation.",

Cognitive impairment will be defined as a 1 standard deviation decline on any test.\n* To determine if baseline serum or cerebrospinal fluid markers or the change from baseline to 1-month are associated with patients with cognitive decline at 4-months after radiation treatment (defined as a 1 standard deviation decline on any test) compared to those without decline."
