            "detailedDescription": "In squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, regional recurrence is rare within lymph node stations treated with elective radiation. However, radiotherapy to the neck is toxic, and leads to a variety of unpleasant side effects, especially coupled with concurrent systemic therapy. There is growing evidence from previous studies showing that lower radiation doses may be adequate in preventing locoregional recurrence of disease. The hypothesis is that lower dose of radiation will have equal effectiveness but less toxicity than standard approaches for the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.\n\nThe study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of reduced dose radiotherapy for definitive and adjuvant treatment of Human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nParticipants will be treated with a radiation therapy regimen that has a lower dose to less tissue area (dose and volume de-escalation) than standard of care radiation therapy. The dosing will be determined by whether concurrent chemotherapy will be given, results from on treatment HPV blood test called NavDx, physical exam, and imaging. On treatment NavDx results indicating a slow (non-rapid) response to the treatment will receive an additional boost of radiation. Routine NavDx testing will be performed to assess treatment response and recurrence. Participants will also be asked to complete surveys about overall health and wellbeing."
