            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nFibroblast-activation protein (FAP) is an enzyme that appears in high numbers in certain cancer cells. \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 is a new tracer-a substance that is injected into a person s body before an imaging scan. Researchers believe that \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 may be able to highlight FAP enzymes more effectively than approved tracers. If so, the new tracer would make it easier to find FAP-positive tumors in the body.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET scans are as good or better than other methods for detecting certain cancers.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years or older with cancer in 1 of these places: the ducts of the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, or small intestine; stomach; bladder; ovaries; or adrenal glands. They must be enrolled in an NIH treatment study for their cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 2 baseline scans: 1 with \\[18F\\]FAPI-74; 1 with an approved tracer.\n\nThe \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 will be infused through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. About 1 hour later, the participant will undergo 1 or more imaging scans.\n\nWithin 1 week, participants will undergo the same scanning procedures with the approved tracer.\n\nIf the baseline scan with \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 shows the tumors, scans with this tracer will be repeated when their regular treatment regimen calls for scans again. If the scans with the regular tracer also showed tumors, this scan will be repeated within the same week as the repeated \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 scans. If either type of scan showed no tumors, that scan will not be repeated.\n\nIf the participant s cancer progresses within 2 years, both types of scan may be repeated.\n\nFollow-up calls will continue for 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Fibroblast-activation protein (FAP) is a transmembrane type 2 serine protease with dipeptidyl peptidase and endopeptidase activity that is overexpressed on the surface of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major constituent of the tumor stroma, which correlates with a poor prognosis.\n* FAP-positive CAFs are present in the stromal tissue of more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, including pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian, lung, and breast cancer among others.\n* FAP has emerged in recent years as a promising target for molecular imaging with PET/Computed Tomography (CT), using radiolabeled FAP inhibitors (FAPI). FAPI labeled with 68Ga or 18F has shown great promise in cancer detection demonstrating high tumor-to-background ratios in patients across a wide array of cancers.\n* While there is much clinical data with 68Ga-FAPI, there is much less data on the efficacy of \\[18F\\]FAPI-74, which is a more practical version of this PET agent due to its longer half-life.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To compare \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET imaging to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging and other imaging considered standard of care (SOC) (e.g., CT, and/or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\]) to detect sites of cancer in several malignancies.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* \\>= 18 years old.\n* Histologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, or pheochromocytoma.\n* Participants must be co-enrolled in an NIH parent cancer treatment clinical trial with the planned evaluation of response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 and other imaging considered SOC.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score \\<= 2.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a single-site imaging study enrolling participants with PDAC, cholangiocarcinoma, HCC, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, or pheochromocytoma. With 25 x 7 = 175 evaluable participants needed, we will plan for a small number of inevaluable participants (35), intending to initiate intervention in up to 210 participants. Note: To allow for screen failures, a total of 220 will be set for the purposes of the NIH accrual ceiling.\n* All participants will undergo baseline \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET and 18F-FDG PET imaging.\n* Participants with a positive baseline \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET scan (i.e., with the presence of FAPIpositive tumor/s) will undergo the second \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET imaging at the time of the next re-staging performed on the parent treatment protocol. Participants with a negative baseline \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET scan will not have post-treatment \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET or 18F-FDG PET scans performed on this protocol but will remain in follow-up.\n* Participants with a negative baseline 18F-FDG PET scan will not be re-scanned with 18F-FDG PET but may be re-scanned with \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET if baseline \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET imaging is positive.\n* All participants will be followed for 2 years following the first \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 PET scan to assess progression-free survival and 2-year overall survival. During this period, participants may undergo the additional \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 and 18F-FDG PET imaging in case of suspicion for recurrence/disease progression. These scans may be done even if the baseline \\[18F\\]FAPI-74 and/or 18F-FDG PET imaging are negative."
