Researchers want to study the effects these foods have on a person s health.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study how different diets affect a person s health and metabolism.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 60 without diabetes who have stable weight and can exercise.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nHeart tests\n\nResting energy expenditure (to determine calorie needs)\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\n20-minute stationary bicycle session\n\nFood, diet, and mental health questionnaires\n\nParticipants will stay at NIH for 4 weeks. They will receive 3 meals a day and may eat as little or as much as they want. The diet will change each week. Their weight will be recorded daily. They will ride a stationary bicycle daily. Each week, they will do the following:\n\nSpend 1 day in a special room that assesses their metabolism\n\nHave 24-hour urine collections\n\nGive skin and fecal samples\n\nRepeat some screening tests\n\nHave scans to measure body fat\n\nComplete computerized behavior tasks\n\nWear an activity monitor to track physical activity\n\nWear a glucose monitor. A sensor will be inserted under the skin with a small needle. It will be replaced weekly.\n\nTake taste tests. They will swish water and flavored liquids around in their mouth and pick which ones had a non-neutral taste. They will also compare liquids for which ones taste better.\n\nParticipation will last for 4 weeks.\n\nSponsoring Institution: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized crossover study of adult volunteers to determine the health effects of four different diets varying in non-beverage energy density, hyperpalatable foods, as well as the degree, extent, and purpose of processing according to the NOVA classification system.\n\nObjectives/Endpoints:\n\nPrimary Aim:\n\nTo determine differences in health effects during four 1-week test diets.\n\nSecondary Aims:\n\nTo determine differences in mean eating rate (grams per minute) and palatability of meals between the four 1-week test diets.\n\nExploratory Aims:\n\nSeveral exploratory measurements are planned to help comprehensively phenotype the effects of the test diets and are intended to be hypothesis-generating."
