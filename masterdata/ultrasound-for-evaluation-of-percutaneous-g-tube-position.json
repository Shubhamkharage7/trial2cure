            "detailedDescription": "This clinical trial will address the validity of using ultrasound to evaluate the position of the gastrostomy tube (GT) retention balloon against the clinical gold standard of fluoroscopic tube injection to assess for potential larger studies and the implementation in clinical practice. This study will address the ability to visualize the retention balloon within the gastric lumen, the ability to assess for leakage from the GT within the abdomen, and the relative length of each study to perform."
