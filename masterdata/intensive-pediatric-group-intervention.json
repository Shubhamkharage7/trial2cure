            "detailedDescription": "Beginning in Fall 2024, the investigators will recruit 6 children with CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System Levels I-III, ages 7-17 years old, to participate in the program. Two students will be assigned to each participant, rotating every 4 weeks due to the structure of the pro-bono clinic. A total of 3 faculty members will supervise. The group will meet for 2 hours, 2 times per week for 15 weeks. Each session will include a 10-minute game-based warm-up, 45 minutes of gait interventions to include treadmill and overground walking as well as other aerobic activities, 45 minutes of resistance training (power and strength training as appropriate for their individual goals), and a 10-minute cool-down incorporating yoga and breathing activities. Participant assessments will be completed during the first week, 7th week, and 15th week. Other programmatic assessments will include students' written reflections on their experiences providing this program, caregiver satisfaction surveys, and participant and caregiver interviews."
