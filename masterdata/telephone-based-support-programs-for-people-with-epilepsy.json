A sample of 120 English- and Spanish-speaking people with epilepsy (PWE) with elevated depressive symptoms will be enrolled. Both interventions are 8-week programs delivered in one-hour weekly sessions to groups of about 6 participants. Changes in depressive symptoms, quality of life and seizures will be assessed over 12 months. The trial will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objectives of the trial are:\n\n1. To test effects of UPLIFT versus BOOST on changes in depressive symptoms (primary outcome) in PWE over 12 months.\n2. To test effects of UPLIFT versus BOOST on changes in quality of life and seizures (secondary outcomes) in PWE over 12 months.\n3. To test whether intervention effects are mediated by increases in mindfulness and decreases in rumination.\n4. To test whether intervention effects are moderated by participant characteristics and facilitator characteristics."
