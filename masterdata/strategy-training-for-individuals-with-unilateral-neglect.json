            "briefSummary": "It is common for individuals after stroke to have a cognitive perceptual impairment called unilateral spatial neglect (neglect). Individuals with neglect have difficulty paying attention to one side of their body or one side of the environment and therefore experience difficulty performing daily activities. There are a lack of effective treatments for neglect and new interventions are needed to help reduce disability for these individuals. Metacognitive strategy training (strategy training) is an intervention that has the potential to reduce neglect-related disability and improve individuals' awareness of their neglect. This study seeks to examine the effects of strategy training on self-awareness, disability, and neglect.",
            "detailedDescription": "Unilateral spatial neglect (neglect) post stroke is characterized by a lack of attention to one side of the body or one side of the environment. Individuals with neglect experience significant disability and are often unaware of their neglect symptoms which can make it even more difficult to treat. There are a lack of effective treatments for neglect and new interventions are needed to help reduce disability for these individuals. Metacognitive strategy training (strategy training) is an intervention that has the potential to reduce neglect-related disability and improve individuals' awareness of their neglect. Strategy training teaches individuals to develop personalized goals, self-assess their performance of daily activities, and develop and evaluate strategies designed to overcome barriers and improve their performance of daily activities. While strategy training shows promise for individuals with neglect, no studies have tailored the intervention for this group of individuals or examined the effects of strategy training for individuals with neglect. This study examines whether strategy training facilitates reductions in disability and neglect and improves self-awareness after acute stroke."
