Following enrolment, patients may (if needed) titrate up their pyridostigmine dose at the investigator's discretion each week to the highest dose deemed appropriate, tolerable and safe."

Any acute or chronic diseases which are associated with GI distress (such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), which could interfere with the subjects' safety during the trial, expose them to undue risk, or interfere with the study objectives.\n2. History or presence of hepatic, or renal disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.\n3. History of substance abuse, known drug addiction, or positive test for drugs of abuse or alcohol.\n4. Patients currently using marijuana for any reason (medical or recreational).\n5. Known hypersensitivity to pyridostigmine, or to ondansetron or similar 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists.\n6. ECG changes including QT interval prolongation and congenital long QT syndrome. Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia's or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation.\n7. Treatment with drugs affecting peripheral cholinergic transmission within 1 month of study entry (with the exception of pyridostigmine).\n8. Subjects unlikely to co-operate during the study, and/or be questionably compliant in the opinion of the investigator.\n9. Patients currently being treated with narcotics.\n10. Patients being treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are contraindicated in myasthenia gravis.\n11. Patients unable to be contacted in case of an emergency.\n12.
