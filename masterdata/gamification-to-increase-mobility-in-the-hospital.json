            "briefSummary": "Low mobility is a mediator for poor outcomes of hospital care. Wearable devices will be used and 2-way texting via patient smartphones to monitor patients' physical activity during hospitalization with and without gamification to improve patient adherence to existing guidance on recommended activity. After discharge, investigators will assess patient care utilization (SNF, inpatient vs home rehab, ED visits, readmission) and conduct validated surveys on patient function at 30 days after discharge.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hospitalization is a common occurrence for older adults; approximately 6.8 million Medicare seniors experience an admission for acute care in any given year. This is often a sentinel event in the overall health trajectory of older adults that is complicated by functional impairment, Skilled Nursing Facility placement, and reduced mobility after discharge.\n\nIn the current paradigm, low mobility during hospitalization is largely viewed as a temporary inconvenience that should not affect overall functional ability or outcomes such nursing home placement and that patients should return to their previous activity level soon after they return home without lingering mobility changes. Recent research, however, suggests disruptions of basic activities of daily life such as mobility (getting out of bed and walking) may be \"traumatic\" or \"toxic\" to older adults with long-term post-hospital effects. What is lacked is precise data on how much immobility is noxious and how much mobility is needed to protect against adverse outcomes.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of a gamification intervention to increase physical activity before hospital discharge. Investigators will explore patients' physical activity while in the hospital and if that differs across floors that have already deployed a nursing mobility protocol (Founders 10, 11, 12, 14). Investigators will also explore changes in patient functional status, SNF placement, and 30-day hospital readmission."
