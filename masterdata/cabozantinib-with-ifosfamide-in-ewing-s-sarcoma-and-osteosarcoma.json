Cabozantinib has been shown to inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases, including potent inhibition of kinases, MET and VEGFR2 which are more commonly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Therefore, the goal of this study is to see if Cabozantinib can be used to inhibit MET and VEGFR2, or other tyrosine kinases to drive tumor responses in patients."
