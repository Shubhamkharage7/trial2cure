            "detailedDescription": "The Understanding and Addressing Rejection of Personalized Cancer Risk Information study seeks to understand the nature of the phenomenon of personalized cancer risk rejection in the context of mammography screening by 1) identifying demographic and psychological factors associated with risk rejection and 2) identify how risk rejection influences risk-concordant mammography seeking behavior. The study will test a priori theory-derived hypotheses about the precursors of risk rejection and the influence of rejection on real-life screening decision making.\n\nThe Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) will be used to asses participant's breast cancer risk. This model is designed to estimate breast cancer risk in women 35-84, and uses the following predictors: 1) age, 2) age at first menstrual period, 3) age at first live birth, 4) first-degree relatives with breast cancer, 5) previous breast biopsy with atypical hyperplasia, and 6) race/ethnicity Participants will be required to complete the baseline survey in which they receive their Gail model risk estimate and respond to that risk estimate. They will then complete a 12-month follow-up survey."
