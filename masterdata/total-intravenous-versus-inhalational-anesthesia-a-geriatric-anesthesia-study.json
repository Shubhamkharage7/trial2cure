            "briefSummary": "Traditionally, general anesthesia is maintained with inhalational anesthesia (GAS), but there is a gap in knowledge regarding whether intravenous anesthesia (IV) can prevent deleterious postoperative outcomes in the geriatric surgical population. The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether intravenous anesthesia (IV) leads to a decreased incidence of postoperative delirium (POD), postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), and functional decline, and improved patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in older adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery when compared to the standard inhalational anesthesia (GAS). This single-center, 1:1 randomized, double-blind (patient \\& outcome assessor) clinical trial will compare inhalational vs. intravenous anesthesia on POD, POCD, functional status, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and blood-based biomarkers in older patients undergoing elective, inpatient, non-cardiac surgery. Upon enrollment, 260 women and men \u2265 70 years undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia will be randomized to 2 groups: TIVA or GAS.",
