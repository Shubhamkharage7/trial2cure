ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the optimal cancer preventive dose of ONC201 defined as the lowest dose with less than or equal to 16.67% of participants experiencing unacceptable toxicity and simultaneously resulting in a statistically significant increase in human adenoma tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the lowest dose of ONC201 with less than or equal to 16.67% of participants experiencing unacceptable toxicity and simultaneously resulting in a statistically significant increase in normal human mucosa TRAIL expression.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of ONC201 when administered weekly and every 3 weeks in participants with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or with multiple adenomas.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of ONC201 on:\n\nIa. Cytokine/immune response profiles (with attention to IL-10, IL-17A, TNF-alpha, IL-6, granzyme A, and perforin) in sera, normal colonic mucosa, and adenomas; Ib. Serum TRAIL concentration; Ic. Serum prolactin concentration; Id. Proliferation markers (Ki67), cell death markers (BCL2, Caspase 3), stemness markers (LGR5, CD44, CD133, ALDH), and natural killers (NK) cell infiltration in adenomas and in normal colonic mucosa; Ie. To evaluate for associations between observed toxicity and TRAIL expression; If. To establish organoids ex vivo and compare adenoma-derived organoid take rates between samples obtained prior to and following treatment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients receive ONC201 orally (PO) once weekly (QW) or once every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo collection of blood, tissue biopsy, and sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should STOP the study medication and inform her study physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior history of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome\n* Participants may not be currently receiving any other investigational agents or have received any investigational agents within the past four weeks\n* Prior history of invasive colorectal cancer\n* Prior invasive active neoplasm that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3 years from registration. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. Participants with a history of prior invasive neoplasm diagnosed and treated greater than 3 years form registration may be considered with consultation of the primary investigator\n* Prior history of exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or ONC201\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ONC201\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant and women who are nursing are excluded from this study because ONC201 is an imipridone agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201",
