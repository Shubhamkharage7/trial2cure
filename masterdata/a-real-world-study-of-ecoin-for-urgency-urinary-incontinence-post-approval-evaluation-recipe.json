(Suspected bladder outlet obstruction will be initially assessed by uroflow study with those having a maximum flow rate \\< 15mL/s requiring additional evaluation.)\n* Individual has predominantly stress urinary incontinence (greater than 1/3 of leaks on baseline diary are stress).\n* Individual has an active urinary tract infection at time of enrollment.\n* Individual has known polyuria.\n* Individual has significant lower urinary tract pain or has been diagnosed with interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome.\n* Individual has abnormal post void residual (i.e. greater than 200 cc initially and on repeat testing after double voiding)\n* Individual has clinically significant urethral stricture disease or bladder neck contracture. (Suspected disease or contracture will be initially assessed by uroflow study with those having a maximum flow rate \\< 15mL/s requiring additional evaluation.)\n* Individual has chronic venous insufficiency with a history of skin change (hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, ulceration) in the ankle region.\n* Individual has morbid obesity and in the opinion of the investigator is not a good candidate for the study.\n* Individual has had diagnosis of bladder, urethral, or prostate cancer.\n* Individual has had a prior anti-stress incontinence sling surgery within the last year.\n* Individual is pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study.\n* Individual has the presence of urinary fistula, bladder stone, or interstitial cystitis.\n* Individual has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (Hemoglobin A1C\\>7) or diabetes with significant peripheral complications. (Uncontrolled diabetes will be ruled out by blood test excluding those with Hemoglobin A1C\\>7).\n* Individual has an implantable neurostimulator, pacemaker, or implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD).\n* Individual has been treated with onabotulinumtoxinA in the previous 9 months prior to enrollment, or more time if the principal investigator judges that the therapeutic effect is present.\n* Individual has been treated with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) within the previous 4 weeks prior to enrollment or more time if the principal investigator judges that the therapeutic effect is present.\n* Individual is currently using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the pelvic region, back, or legs.\n* Individual is aware that he or she will need an MRI scan other than a head/neck/shoulder MRI during the study period.\n* Individual has a clotting or bleeding disorder or is using anticoagulant therapies and in the opinion of the investigator is not a good candidate for the study (antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy may be continued or held at the discretion of the investigator).\n* Individual is neutropenic or immune-compromised.\n* Individual has had previous surgery and/or significant scarring at the implant location.\n* Individual has ongoing dermatologic condition at the implant site, including but not limited to dermatitis and autoimmune disorders.\n* Individual has a clinically significant peripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities.\n* Individual has neurogenic bladder dysfunction.\n* Individual has pitting edema at implant location (\u2265 2+ is excluded).\n* Individual has inadequate skin integrity or any evidence of an infection or inflammation in either lower leg.\n* Individual has varicose veins and is symptomatic.\n* Individual has open wounds, trauma, or prior surgery in the lower extremities.\n* Individual has arterial disease in the lower extremities.\n* Individual has vasculitis in the lower extremities.\n* Individual has bladder stones or neoplasia. (Suspected bladder stones or neoplasia will be ruled out with a urine dipstick showing no more than trace blood, and microscopic analysis (which should be done in that case) shows \u22653 PBC's /HPF unless that subject has been worked up and found negative for clinically significant disease such as malignant neoplasm or stones.)\n* In the opinion of the investigator, Individual is not a good candidate for participation in the study.",
