            "briefSummary": "The study will evaluate 300 people living with HIV that attend the Vivent Clinic for HIV care. We will characterize our population and include age, race/ethnicity, sex at birth, tobacco use, alcohol use, other comorbidities, HPV vaccination status, other HPV disease, and lab values such as CD4 count and HIV viral load. We will compare results between participants who are HPV positive and negative. We will also evaluate the relationship between HPV oral infections and lesions and the variables above to better understand possible predictors of HPV infections and lesions.",
            "detailedDescription": "Vivent Health is a non-profit medical home model dedicated to the primary care of People Living with HIV (PLWH) and also provides pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), Hepatitis C, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment. The organization has clinics in Wisconsin (multiple cities), Denver, St. Louis, Austin and Kansas City. All insurances except Kaiser are honored and non-insured people are able to be seen. The Denver medical clinic is a designated medical home that provides adult primary medical and specialty care to approximately 1000 + PLWH. In additional to medical care, this clinic has an onsite pharmacy, case management, HIV and Hepatitis C prevention department, syringe access program, legal department, housing specialists, food bank, a mental health program and dental services. Vivent Health in Denver cares for a diverse population with approximately 11% African-American, 13% Latino, and a recently increasing percentage of women around 13%. This clinic has a strong Electronic Health Record System (EHR- Epic) which provides ample opportunity to recruit a robust study population to investigate the following co-morbidities which might increase the risk of oral HPV infection and related lesions. Given the lack of recommended routine screening for oral HPV in the absence of established masses or lesions, there is a wealth of opportunities to investigate risk factors associated with the presence and prevalence of oral HPV which, in turn, can potentially be used to inform screening and treatment protocols. This proposal is designed to evaluate the prevalence of oral HPV infections and associated oral lesions and associated demographics in HIV treatment clinic."

The 15-ml samples will then be stored at -20 and then shipped on dry ice to Dr. Anna Giuliano's laboratory in Tampa Florida for HPV testing. At present Dr. Giuliano's laboratory is using the DDL SPF10 LiPA assay for sample analysis. An oral exam will be performed for each patient by the Vivent Dentist within 30 days of the collection of the HPV sample. If a referral is needed to an oral surgeon or Ears, Nose, and Throat specialist this will be done within 60 days of the dentist visit. The HPV results will not be shared with the participants as these are research study results and not part of standard of care.",
