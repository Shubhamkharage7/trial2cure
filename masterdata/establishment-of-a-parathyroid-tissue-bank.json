The tissue bank will contain both normal parathyroid tissue and diseased tissue, and will provide a resource for the ongoing study of parathyroid disease and management.",

Collections may be made at any or all of the following timepoints: preoperatively, during intervention, and/or at subsequent follow-up visits for up to fifteen years."
