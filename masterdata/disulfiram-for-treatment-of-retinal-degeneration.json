The resulting hyperactivity of retinal ganglion cells leads to further diminution of the remaining vision in those afflicted with inherited retinal diseases. Inhibition of this pathway has led to improved visual function in murine models of retinal degeneration. This can be accomplished in humans with the FDA-approved irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenases, disulfiram."
