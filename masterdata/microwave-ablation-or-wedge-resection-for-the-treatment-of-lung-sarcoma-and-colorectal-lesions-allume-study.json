            "briefSummary": "This study compares the outcomes and safety of two standard treatment options called microwave ablation and surgical wedge resection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, sarcoma and colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Microwave ablation is designed to kill tumor cells by heating the tumor until the tumor cells die. A wedge resection is a procedure that involves the surgical removal of a small, wedge-shaped piece of lung tissue to remove a small tumor or to diagnose lung cancer. Comparing these two treatment options may help researchers learn which method works better for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic sarcoma, and metastatic colorectal cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Estimate the 2-year local recurrence rate for microwave ablation within a basket.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for safety when compared to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical patient population.\n\nII. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for efficacy when compared to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical patient population.\n\nIII. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for changes in patient reported outcomes when compared to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical patient population.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo standard care microwave ablation or wedge resection followed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Patients also complete questionnaires over 10-15 minutes at baseline up to 9 months."
