As optional extensions of the main study, participants may also undergo a biopsy of extra sino-nasal tissue for additional tissue analysis and/or a more detailed characterization visit performed in the UCSF Airway Center Research Center (ACRC).",

Participants will donate leftover sino-nasal secretions and tissue from their procedures. In addition, participants will be subject to medical record review and research questionnaires.\n\nIn many instances, these participants will have multiple procedures over time to treat recurrent disease and this study will allow for them to donate leftover biospecimens as many as 9 times.\n\nParticipants may also opt to undergo a turbinate mucosal tissue biopsy during regularly scheduled sinus surgery for additional tissue analysis and/or undergo a more detailed, complete characterization visit performed in the UCSF Airway Center Research Center (ACRC). During the complete characterization, participants will undergo lung function tests, sputum induction and blood collection, in addition to the procedures mentioned above."
