            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies if talazoparib works in patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and has mutation(s) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes who have or have not already been treated with another PARP inhibitor. Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP, a protein that helps repair damaged DNA. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. All patients who take part on this study must have a gene aberration that changes how their tumors are able to repair DNA. This trial may help scientists learn whether some patients might benefit from taking different PARP inhibitors \"one after the other\" and learn how talazoparib works in treating patients with advanced cancer who have aberration in DNA repair genes.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of talazoparib in tumor biopsies for patients with aberrations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes who have or have not received prior PARP inhibitor treatment (separately).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the response rate (complete response \\[CR\\] + partial response \\[PR\\]) of treatment with talazoparib in patients with aberrations in DNA damage response genes.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Investigate tumor genomic alterations potentially associated with sensitivity or acquired resistance to talazoparib.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."
