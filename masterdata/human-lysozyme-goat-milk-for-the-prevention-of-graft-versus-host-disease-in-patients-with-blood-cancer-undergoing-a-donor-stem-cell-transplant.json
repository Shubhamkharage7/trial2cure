            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of human lysozyme goat milk in preventing graft versus host disease in patients with blood cancer undergoing a donor stem cell transplant. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can cause an immune response against the body's own normal cells (call graft versus host disease). The goat milk in the study is from goats that have been genetically engineered to produce human lysozyme in the milk. Human lysozyme is a natural enzyme found in human milk and acts as an antimicrobial. Lysozyme is key to the digestive health of breast-fed human infants, since it helps the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and reduces the growth of bacteria that causes diarrhea and intestinal disease. Giving human lysozyme goat milk may reduce the rate of graft versus host disease in blood cancer patients undergoing a donor stem cell transplant.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of human lysozyme goat milk (hLZ) treatment by assessing:\n\nIa: Type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration of adverse events, including diarrhea, bloodstream/intestinal infections.\n\nIb. Patients' ability to drink the specified volume (250 ml 3 x/day) of hLZ during the treatment period.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) among hLZ-treated and untreated patients, including diarrhea, bloodstream infections and intestinal infections.\n\nII. To obtain preliminary estimates of gut microbiome diversity, as assessed by the Simpson Index, in hLZ-treated/untreated patients.\n\nIII. To compare gut microbiome diversity among hLZ-treated/untreated patients. IV. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the possible association between gut microbiome diversity and bloodstream infections.\n\nV. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the possible association between gut microbiome diversity and acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) cumulative incidence, including time to onset.\n\nVI. To characterize and compare GVHD inflammatory biomarkers (presence, level) among hLZ-treated and untreated patients.\n\nVII. To characterize and compare urinary uindoxyl sulfate, tryptophan and kynurenine levels between hLZ-treated and untreated patients.\n\nIX. To obtain a preliminary estimate of gut microbiome diversity and calorie intake.\n\nX. To estimate overall survival (OS) cumulative incidence (CI) chronic GVHD of relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days (excluding chronic GVHD), 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP A:\n\nCONDITIONING: Patients receive palifermin on days -10 to -8 and days 0 to 2, undergo fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) on days -7 to -4, and receive cyclophosphamide on days -3 to -2 or etoposide on day -3 per City of Hope (COH) standard operating procedure (SOP) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nHLZ: Patients receive human lysozyme goat milk orally (PO) three times daily (TID) on days -8 to 28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nTRANSPLANT: Patients undergo stem cell transplant on day 0.\n\nGVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -2, patients receive tacrolimus and sirolimus daily per COH SOP in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nGROUP B:\n\nCONDITIONING: Patients receive palifermin on days -10 to -8 and days 0 to 2 per COH SOP, undergo FTBI on days -7 to -4, and receive cyclophosphamide on days -3 to -2 or etoposide on day -3 per COH SOP in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nTRANSPLANT: Patients undergo stem cell transplant on day 0.\n\nGVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -2, patients receive tacrolimus and sirolimus daily per COH SOP in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 30-100 days and then up to 2 years after transplant."
