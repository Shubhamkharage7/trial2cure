There are two parts to this trial, part 1 and part 2.\n\nPart 1 of the trial aims to answer these questions:\n\n* The safety and tolerability of VIO-01 when it is given alone or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.\n* The highest dose that people can take without having unacceptable side effects\n* How well your body tolerates the drug alone or in combination, how they are absorbed, and the effects they have on your disease.\n\nPart 2 of the trial will further test VIO-01's effect in participants with advanced HRRm or HRD+ solid tumors and HRRm/HRD+ recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\nParticipants will follow a schedule of visits to the study site to have assessments done related to their health condition and to receive the trial treatment.",

Willingness to provide pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies.\n\nParticipant Exclusion Criteria\n\nThe following criteria must be checked at the time of screening and at baseline. If ANY exclusion criterion applies, the participant must not be included in the study:\n\n1. Phase 2 Only: Have received more than one prior line of therapy in metastatic setting.\n\n   Note: Phase 1 has no limits for prior lines of therapy.\n2.
