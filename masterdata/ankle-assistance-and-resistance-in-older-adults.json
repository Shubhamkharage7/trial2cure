The first aim is to study if targeted ankle resistance gait training improves walking performance in older individuals. The second aim is to evaluate the potential of wearable assistance at the ankle, knee, and/or hip joints to increase walking performance in older individuals.",

This goal will be accomplished by focusing on two specific research aims. The first aim is to study if targeted ankle resistance gait training improves walking performance in older individuals. The second aim is to evaluate the potential of wearable assistance at the ankle, knee, and/or hip joints to increase walking performance in older individuals.\n\nSeveral powered orthosis conditions will be tested during several modes of walking or running and balance throughout the course of the study. Trials will take place over-ground and/or on a treadmill. Balance trials will take place on a treadmill. Participants will walk for up to 40 minutes. Frequent breaks will be provided between trials and conditions to avoid fatigue; a maximum of 15 minutes of continuous walking will take place between breaks."
