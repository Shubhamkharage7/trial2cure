For patients with unknown HIV status, HIV testing will be performed at Screening and result should be negative for the patient to be eligible.\n   * Known active Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection\n   * Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are excluded. Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative HBsAg require HBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation. Patients who are HBV PCR positive will be excluded. Due to rituximab's black box warning for Hepatitis B reactivation, patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) should have prophylactic therapy with an approved nucleos(t)ide analogue to prevent reactivation.\n   * Hepatitis C virus (HCV): If hepatitis C antibody result is positive, patient will need to have a negative result for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA). Patients who are hepatitis C RNA positive will be excluded.\n8.

Correction of suspected drug induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation.\n10. History of cerebral vascular accident \u2264 6 months prior to registration.\n11. Oxygen dependent lung disease (such as interstitial lung disease or COPD).\n12. Ongoing inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis) requiring active treatment.\n13. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n14. Major surgery \u2264 28 days prior to registration.\n15. Vaccination with a live vaccine \u2264 28 days prior to registration.\n16.
