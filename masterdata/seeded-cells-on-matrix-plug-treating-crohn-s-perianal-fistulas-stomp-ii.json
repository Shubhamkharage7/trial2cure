            "briefSummary": "A Phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of AVB-114 in treatment of complex Crohn's perianal fistulas in subjects with quiescent rectal disease and whose fistula has failed to respond to biologic or conventional therapy. Combined remission of treated perianal fistula in the investigational treatment arm will be compared to a standard of care control arm.\n\nThe study has 2 parts:\n\nPart 1: All required study visits for subjects who initially receive study treatment and those who receive standard of care therapy (control arm).\n\nPart 2: Subjects who are enrolled in the control arm may receive treatment with AVB-114 following week 36. Those subjects then will be followed as specified in the clinical protocol.",
            "detailedDescription": "AVB-114 is an investigational therapy which offers a new therapeutic approach to treating this unmet medical need. The drug product is a mesenchymal cell substrate system comprised of autologous mesenchymal cells incubated with a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable substrate. The drug substance is expanded, pure mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which are known to modulate local inflammation and orchestrate tissue healing. By incubating cells with a 3-dimensional bioabsorbable substrate designed for anal fistula geometry, cells are locally delivered into the fistula tract to promote healing."

Subjects previously treated with Cx601/Alofisel or other allogeneic or autologous stem-cell therapy within the past 6 months.\n15. Contraindications to the anesthetic procedure (local and general) or to the adipose tissue collection procedure.\n16. Subjects with one or more of the following fistula types or anatomic presentations:\n\n    1. Horseshoe fistulas\n    2. Fistulas that do not have an opening inside the anal canal or low rectum\n    3. Blind ending sinus tracts (no external opening)\n    4. Branching fistulas.
