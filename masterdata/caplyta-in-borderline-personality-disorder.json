            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Caplyta (lumateperone) in adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Sixty subjects with BPD will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either Caplyta (42mg/day) or matching placebo for 8 weeks of active treatment. The hypothesis to be tested is that Caplyta will result in greater rates of reduction in symptoms of BPD compared to placebo (improvement in symptoms will be indicated by lower scores on established outcome measures of BPD symptoms that have been used in prior studies).",
            "detailedDescription": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious, difficult to treat, psychiatric disorder that causes significant emotional distress, as well as resulting in significant economic burden to health care systems. A variety of psychotherapies, particularly dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving (STEPPS), have shown benefit in reducing many of the core symptoms of BPD. Healthcare systems, however, often lack the funding and appropriate expertise to implement these treatments, and finding trained DBT or STEPPS therapists has been difficult for many people with BPD. While research on the use of medication is ongoing, no drug has yet been approved in the United States or elsewhere for the treatment of BPD. Antidepressants, anti-convulsants, and second generation antipsychotics have all been examined, but current medication options for BPD often provide only partial relief and may have pronounced side effects.\n\nBPD is characterized by a pervasive pattern of severe psychopathological symptoms with instability of affect regulation, impulse control, and aggression. Dysfunctions in the serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems have been demonstrated in-and considered as possible causes for-symptoms associated with the disorder. Caplyta (lumateperone) therefore has distinctive properties that make it a promising option for patients with BPD. Caplyta is a mechanistically novel agent as it simultaneously modulates serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, the key neurotransmitters implicated in BPD. Specifically, Caplyta acts as a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, a dopamine D2 receptor pre-synaptic partial agonist and post-synaptic antagonist, a D1 receptor-dependent modulator of glutamate, and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In addition, because of low rates of side effects, Caplyta should be a well-tolerated and in fact desired medication approach to BPD.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy and safety of Caplyta vs. placebo in adults with BPD, as indicated by a score of at least 9 on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (\"Zanarini scale\"), a scale of illness severity, at the baseline visit."
