Similar to all studies that will be coordinated and managed by the CDMC, no patient enrollment will occur at MDACC. All patient recruitment will occur at external sites that are a part of the CPDPC, which are listed in the appended DETECT protocol. The data management systems, auditing, and monitoring effort are supported by the CDMC.",

Evaluate the pancreatic polypeptide response following a standardized mixed meal in new onset diabetes associated with PDAC (particularly with a proximal tumor) and chronic pancreatitis vs. T2DM.\n2. Evaluate the insulin and glucagon response following a standardized mixed meal in new onset diabetes associated with PDAC and chronic pancreatitis vs. T2DM.\n3. Evaluate the incretin response following a standardized mixed meal in new onset diabetes associated with PDAC and chronic pancreatitis vs. T2DM.\n4. Explore the differences in analytes from Objectives 1-3 in a cohort of subjects with the same diseases and long-standing DM or normoglycemia.\n5. Evaluate differences in fasting levels of insulin and novel biomarkers in pancreatic cancer compared to chronic pancreatitis and T2DM.\n6. Explore the metabolic alterations (including pancreatic polypeptide response and insulin secretion) in diabetes associated with pancreatic surgery for chronic pancreatitis."

Conversely, the use of these medications is permitted for subjects in the CP and PDAC groups.\n* Patients currently receiving oral steroid medications.\n* Hospitalization for acute pancreatitis within 2 months before study visit (with the exception of subjects enrolled into the PDAC group, as this may be a symptom of the disease).\n* The presence of a symptomatic cyst in subjects with CP. The presence of a cyst in subjects with pancreatic cancer is not an exclusion, including cancer arising from a mucinous cystic lesion.\n* Any subject with a known pancreatic cancer histologic subtype other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., subjects with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are excluded).\n* Previous pancreatic surgery (including total pancreatectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, pancreaticojejunostomy, enucleation, or Frey procedure). An exception to this criterion are subjects with CP who had a history of surgery (including pancreaticoduodenectomy, pancreatic ojejunostomy, distal pancreatectomy, or Frey).\n* Previous treatment for pancreatic cancer, including chemotherapy or radiation.\n* Previous vagotomy or gastric surgery, including endoscopic gastric reduction procedures.\n* Previous diagnosis of gastroparesis.\n* Patients on treatment for any cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix).\n* Allergy or intolerance to ingredients in Boost drink in subjects undergoing mixed meal testing",
