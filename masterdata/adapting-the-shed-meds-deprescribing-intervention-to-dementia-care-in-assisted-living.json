            "briefSummary": "This single-arm pilot study will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce exposure to unnecessary or potentially harmful medications among residents with dementia living in an assisted living facility. The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications (defined by dose reductions and stopped medications), based on a combination of clinical criteria and resident/surrogate preferences. The investigators will evaluate the effects of the intervention on the total number of medications deprescribed from enrollment at 30, 60, and 90 days along with resident/surrogate reports of quality of life at enrollment and 90 days.",
            "detailedDescription": "This single-arm pilot trial will evaluate an evidence-based, patient-centered deprescribing intervention with assisted living facility (ALF) residents age 65+ who have a diagnosis of dementia. This deprescribing intervention was demonstrated to be safe and effective in reducing medication burden during the Shed-MEDS randomized clinical trial that enrolled hospitalized older adults discharging to post-acute care facilities. The intervention includes a comprehensive review of a participant's medications by the study's clinician and deprescribing recommendations using evidence-based guidelines. Deprescribing recommendations will be shared with residents/surrogate decision makers (i.e., respective family member/s) to determine their willingness to stop or reduce the dose of the targeted medications. If the resident/surrogate-decision maker agrees, deprescribing recommendations will then be communicated with the routine ALF medical providers for consideration and final deprescribing decisions."
