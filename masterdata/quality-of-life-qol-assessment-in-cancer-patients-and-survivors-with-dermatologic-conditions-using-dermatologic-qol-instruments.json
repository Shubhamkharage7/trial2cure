Skin conditions are common in cancer patients and survivors. Sometimes, the skin condition is directly related to the cancer. Other times, these conditions are a side effect of cancer treatment. Patients in the study will be asked to fill out at least one questionnaire about how they feel about their skin condition. If the patient needs to be treated for their skin condition, they will be asked to complete the same questionnaire when they return for a follow-up visit. The investigators hope the study will improve our understanding of how cancer patients feel about their skin conditions. They also hope this study helps them learn how to improve the way we treat skin conditions in cancer patients."
