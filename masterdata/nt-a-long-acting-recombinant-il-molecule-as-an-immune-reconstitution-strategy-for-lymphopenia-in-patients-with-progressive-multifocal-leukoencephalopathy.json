            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a brain infection. It is caused by a virus. PML can happen in people with a weakened immune system. PML is associated with cognitive and visual impairment as well as motor and speech disturbances. There is no treatment for PML. Researchers want to see if a new drug can help.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if the drug NT-I7 can help increase lymphocyte numbers, which may help control PML infection.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older with PML who are enrolled in Protocol #13-N-0017.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened under Protocol #13-N-0017.\n\nParticipants will have a 7-day inpatient stay, outpatient visits, and follow-up phone calls.\n\nParticipants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will give urine samples. Blood will be drawn from an arm vein or through an intravenous (IV) catheter.\n\nParticipants will get up to 3 doses of NT-I7. It will be given by injection into the muscle.\n\nParticipants will have lumbar punctures ( spinal taps ). A thin needle will be inserted into the spinal canal in the lower back. Cerebrospinal fluid will be removed. X-ray may be used to guide the procedure.\n\nParticipants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. During MRIs, participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. Soft padding or a coil will be placed around their head. They will get gadolinium, a contrast agent, through an IV catheter.\n\nParticipation will last for 12 to 19 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis protocol will test whether NT-I7 is a viable strategy for promoting immune reconstitution in lymphopenic patients with PML. Twelve adults with PML and lymphopenia (CD4 or CD8 T cell count of less than or equal to 200 cells/dL) from all causes will complete this pilot study. Patients will be observed as inpatient for the first 7 days following any experimental drug dosing. To follow, patients will return to NIH for a second 7-day inpatient stay by Day 21, and then for scheduled outpatient visits at NIH at month 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 following any drug dosing. Follow up phone calls will be conducted at month 4, 5, 7 and 8. Patients may be eligible for a second dose of NT-I7 at higher dose if target ALC (1000/microliter) not reached, or at same dose if initial response is adequate but not sustained, for a maximum of 3 doses. The primary outcome measure is change in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC). Secondary outcomes include safety and tolerability. Exploratory clinical, radiological, and laboratory measures will be obtained to investigate mechanism of action of NT-I7 and for biomarker development.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the kinetics and magnitude of effect of NT-I7 on absolute lymphocyte counts in patients with PML and underlying lymphopenia from various causes, in order to inform appropriate design of a future study.\n\nSecondary Objectives: (1) To assess safety and tolerability of NT-I7. (2) To determine kinetics and magnitude of effect of NT-I7 on lymphocyte subsets. (3) To investigate effect of NT-I7 on PML disease course. (4) To investigate mechanism of action of NT-I7.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Change in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) over 6 months.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: (1) Adverse event tables. (2) Change in lymphocyte subset counts, including CD4, CD8 and CD19 positive cells (3) Change in standardized disability rating scales, PML lesion extension by brain MRI, viral quantification in CSF and survival. (4) Exploratory serological and CSF measures to investigate immune response to JCV and mechanism of action of NT-I7."
