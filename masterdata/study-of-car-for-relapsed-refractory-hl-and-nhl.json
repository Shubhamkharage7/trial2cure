            "briefSummary": "The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.\n\nIn previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\n\nPrimary Objective (Phase Ib portion of Study) To establish a safe dose (ie, number cells/m2) of ATLCAR.CD30 to infuse after lymphodepletion with

infused after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine.\n\nTo measure patient-reported symptom, physical function, and health-related quality of life at baseline and over time in adult patients treated with CAR.CD30 T cells.\n\nPrimary Endpoint (Phase Ib)\n\nToxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0) and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) toxicity will be graded according to the CRS Management Guidelines and CRS Toxicity Grading Scale\n\nPrimary Endpoint (Phase II)\n\nPFS is defined from day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients with a documented complete response at time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients without complete response at time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per the Lugano classification\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\nOverall survival will be measured from the date of administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL to date of death and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for lymphodepletion.\n\nProgression free survival is defined from day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients with a documented complete response at time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients without complete response at time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per the Lugano classification78 and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for lymphodepletion.\n\nThe objective response rate will be defined as the rate of complete responses (CR) + partial responses (PR) as determined by the Lugano classification78 and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for lymphodepletion.\n\nThe duration of response will be defined as time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for lymphodepletion.\n\nToxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). S\n\nPersistence of CAR.CD30 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry in peripheral blood samples and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for lymphodepletion.\n\nFor adult patients: Patient reported symptoms will be measured using selected symptoms from the NCI PRO-CTCAE. Patient-reported physical function will be measured using the PROMIS Physical Function Score derived from the PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 20a v1.0. Patient-reported health-related quality of life will be measured using the PROMIS Global Health Score derived from the PROMIS Global Health Short Form v1.0-1.1.\n\nOUTLINE\n\nCell Procurement\n\nUp to 100 mL per collection (up to 3 collections) of peripheral blood will be obtained from patients for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry less than 200/\u03bcl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.\n\nATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration\n\nATLCAR.CD30 cells will be administered as described below 1-14 days (preferably 1-2 days) after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine. ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be given by a licensed provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line. The expected volume will be 1-50cc. Patients with a partial response or stable disease at 6 weeks may receive a second infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 if cells are available. Note: Lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine will occur for three consecutive days and may be given prior to a second infusion of cells (if applicable).\n\nDuration of Therapy\n\nTherapy in Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) 1532 involves 1-2 infusions of ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless:\n\n* Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR\n* General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\n\nDuration of Follow-up\n\nPatients will be followed for up to 15 years for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event."
