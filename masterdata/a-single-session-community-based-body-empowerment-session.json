            "briefSummary": "This present study will examine the effectiveness of a single session, virtually delivered body empowerment program for decreasing participants thin ideal internalization. The intervention asks participants to identify cultural norms surrounding appearance and attractiveness, then challenge these ideals. Participants will answer questions about thin ideal internalization before and after the program.",
            "detailedDescription": "A body empowerment program rooted in the psychological theory of cognitive dissonance has been shown to be effective to reduce the value of the thin beauty ideal. This theory proposes that humans are motivated to maintain consistency in their beliefs and actions, and inconsistencies will result in psychological discomfort (or cognitive dissonance). A shift in beliefs or actions is required to resolve this discomfort and maintain consistency. However, the accessibility of this program is lacking. The proposed study will examine the effectiveness of a single session, virtually delivered body empowerment program designed to create cognitive dissonance by asking participants to identify cultural norms surrounding appearance and attractiveness, then challenge these ideals through a series of interactive activities in a fully virtual, self-paced module. Challenging these ideals (e.g., identifying how ideals represent very narrow identities and are informed by oppressive value systems, stating the psychological costs of trying to change your body to match ideals) theoretically creates cognitive dissonance in those who have internalized the value of pursuing those ideals. This dissonance is resolved through a reduced investment in the ideals and then hypothesized to lead to more positive attitudes about body image, dieting, and other unhealthy weight control behaviors. The program consists of a single 45-minute self paced, interactive, virtual module. Primary assessments will be completed at pre-intervention and post-intervention."
