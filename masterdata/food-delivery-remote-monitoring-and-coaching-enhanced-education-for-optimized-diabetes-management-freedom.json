FREEDOM Study (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):\n\n   The FREEDOM study is a 12-month clinical trial enrolling 304 Black adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus across three healthcare systems in Alabama and Mississippi. Participants are randomly assigned to one of eight combinations of three intervention components:\n   * Digital Health Coaching: Participants receive one-on-one phone-based coaching for optimized diabetes management.\n   * Food Box Delivery: Food boxes are delivered every two weeks to participants' homes,\n   * Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM): Participants receive essential supplies, including glucometers, for remote blood glucose measurement. Data is monitored remotely for timely interventions.\n\n   The study involves three in-person visits at baseline, month 6, and month 12, as well as two telephone study check-ins at month 3 and 9. Survey packets are administered at each time point.\n2. FREEDOM-HIV Study (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and HIV Cohort):\n\nAdditionally, a cohort within the study, known as the FREEDOM-HIV study, will enroll additional 80 adults who have both Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and HIV. This cohort will be observed over a 6-month period and will also consist of the same three intervention components."

Given this, we rely on the eloquent and rigorous MOST-based optimization design, which leverages factorial experimentation to identify an optimal set of intervention component(s). In a factorial experiment, the goal is not to compare individual experimental conditions (in this case, eight conditions), but to use combinations of conditions to estimate the main and interaction effects of the intervention components. Thus, numerous intervention components can be evaluated simultaneously while utilizing the entire randomized sample.",
