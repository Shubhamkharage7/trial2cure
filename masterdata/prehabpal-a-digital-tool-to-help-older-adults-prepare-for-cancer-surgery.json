PrehabPal is a web app designed with, and for, older adults preparing for surgery at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). This app has the potential to fill a crucial clinical gap for older cancer patients by designing an individualized prehabilitation program and providing prehabilitation coaching.",

Determine the effectiveness of PrehabPal in delivering prehabilitation and improving outcomes for elders who undergo colorectal cancer surgery.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the impact of PrehabPal on surgical outcomes and functional recovery compared to standard written surgery prehabilitation materials.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions. Study participation will continue for up to 12 weeks, with intervention 7-21 days before surgery and a follow-up visit 8 weeks after surgery."
