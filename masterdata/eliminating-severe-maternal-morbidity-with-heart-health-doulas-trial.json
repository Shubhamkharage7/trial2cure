            "briefSummary": "This is a single site, single-blinded parallel randomized control trial that investigates a multi-level intervention to improve postpartum blood pressure in women with hypertensive disorder pregnancy. The investigators will recruit women diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, identified between 3rd trimester and 2 weeks post-delivery. The investigators will randomize participants to receive usual care home blood pressure monitoring for 6 weeks versus an intervention of usual care + blood pressure and weight monitoring + a doula trained in heart health. This trial will be conducted in partnership with a local community-based organization, Healthy Start Inc.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to improve blood pressure in women who have a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. A hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is one in which a woman's blood pressure is elevated during pregnancy. For the purpose of this project, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy includes gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia. By improving blood pressure in pregnant women, the investigators aim to lower the number of women with chronic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The study will enroll 454 women who are 18 years or older, are about to or have recently given birth, and have been diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Women will be randomly chosen to take part in usual care or an intervention group.\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate support for new moms by providing a postpartum doula in partnership with Healthy Start Inc. Healthy Start is a local community-based organization that supports women, children, fathers, families and communities through community-based programming, advocacy, research, and training. The support provided to new moms will include weekly doula sessions (in-person or virtual), education and support, and blood pressure and weight monitoring. Women will be enrolled during their third trimester up until they are a few weeks postpartum and will complete the study around 12 months postpartum. If assigned to the intervention group, women will attend weekly check-ins with their doula for 8-12 weeks and receive continuous blood pressure and weight monitoring throughout the duration of the study. Both groups will be enrolled into a 6-week home-based blood pressure monitoring program with text messaging support (enrollment in the 6-week program is the standard of care at Magee Women's Hospital following a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy). Both the usual care and intervention groups will attend a follow-up visit at 12 months postpartum."
