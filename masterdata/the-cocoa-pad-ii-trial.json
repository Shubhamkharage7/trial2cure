The study will randomize 190 participants with PAD age 55 and older to one of two groups for six months: cocoa flavanols vs placebo. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at six-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are Actigraph-measured physical activity, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphorylated eNOS, gastrocnemius muscle perfusion (measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and gastrocnemius muscle characteristics (measured by muscle biopsy).\n\nTo achieve the specific aims, the study will randomize 190 participants age 55 and older with PAD to one of two groups: cocoa flavanols vs placebo. Participants will be followed for six months."
