            "detailedDescription": "Hard to heal Chronic wounds affect a significant percentage of patients over their lifetime. For example, diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a major health complication that affect up to 15% of individuals with diabetes mellitus over their lifetime. The treatment of hard to heal chronic wounds is extremely challenging as ulcers such as DFUs and Venous Leg Ulcers (VLUs) may not respond to standard of care (SC) treatment and frequently become infected.\n\nAdvanced wound products like CAMPs have become an important strategy in the treatment of hard-to-heal chronic wounds by trapping and binding the patients' own cells to rebuild the dermis layer of the skin to aid in healing.\n\nThe study will evaluate the clinical utility of Multiple CAMPs in the closure of hard to heal diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers in subjects in comparison to Standard of Care treatment."

The surface area of the target ulcer has reduced in size by more than 20% in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screening visit (\"historical\" run-in period). Moleculight Imaging Device is not required for measurements taken during the historical run-in period (e.g., calculating surface area using length X width is acceptable).\n13. The surface area measurement of the Target ulcer decreases by 20% or more during the 2-week screening phase: the 2 weeks from the initial screening visit (S1) to the TV- 1 visit during which time the potential subject received SOC.\n14. The potential subject has an acute Charcot foot, or an inactive Charcot foot, which impedes proper offloading of the target ulcer.\n15.

The ulcer penetrates down to muscle, tendon, or bone.\n4. Presence of another venous leg ulcer within 2 cm of the index ulcer. If more than one ulcer is present on the lower extremity, the largest qualifying ulcer will be chosen as the target ulcer.\n5.

Participation in a clinical trial involving treatment with an investigational product within the previous 30 days.\n13. A potential subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has a medical or psychological condition that may interfere with study assessments.\n14. The target ulcer was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) or a Cellular, Acellular, Matrix-like Product (CAMP) in the 30 days prior to the initial screening visit.\n15. The potential subject has a malnutrition indicator score \\<17 as measured on the Mini Nutrition Assessment\n16. If diabetic, the potential subject has glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than or equal to 12% within 3 months of the initial screening visit.\n17. The surface area of the target ulcer has reduced in size by more than 20% in the 2 weeks prior to the initial screening visit (\"historical\" run-in period). MolecuLight Imaging Device is not required for measurements taken during the historical run-in period (e.g., calculating surface area using length X width is acceptable). The patient must have received compression during the historical run-in period.\n18. The surface area measurement of the Target ulcer decreases by 20% or more during the active 2-week screening phase: the 2 weeks from the initial screening visit (S1) to the TV-1 visit during which time the potential subject received SOC.\n19. In the last 8 weeks - Amputation or revascularization (surgical or stenting) to the affected leg\n20. Presence of any condition (including current drug or alcohol abuse, medical or psychiatric condition) that is likely to impair understanding of or compliance with the study protocol in the judgment of the Investigator.\n21.
