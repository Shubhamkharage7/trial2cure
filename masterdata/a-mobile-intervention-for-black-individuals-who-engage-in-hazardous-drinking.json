The application uses a personalized feedback intervention (PFI) designed to enhance knowledge regarding adverse anxiety-alcohol interrelations, increase motivation and intention to reduce hazardous drinking, and reduce positive attitudes and intention regarding anxiety-related alcohol use among Black hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety.",

Next, Black hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety will assess program navigation and conduct usability testing. Finally, Black hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety will be recruited to complete the final prototype of the mobile health application in order to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects. Initial screening will be conducted via Zoom; baseline and post-treatment data will be collected via Zoom and 1-week, 1-month, and 3-months follow-up data will be collected remotely."
