Flexible intubation scope and video laryngoscope are devices that have a small camera to help the doctor see the patient's airway on a screen. Both devices may help the doctor who gives anesthesia prevent complications from placing the breathing tube (such as pain or mouth injury).",

To compare the rates of difficult endotracheal tube (ETT) placement using a flexible intubation scope (FIS) versus a combination of flexible intubation and video laryngoscopy in difficult airway management.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the ease of using a flexible intubation scope (FIS) with and without the use of the video laryngoscope (VL).\n\nII. Total time for securing the airway.\n\nIII. Number of attempts required for intubation.\n\nIV. Rate of failure at intubation.\n\nV. Incidence of desaturation.\n\nVI. Assessment for hoarseness, sore mouth, neck, or jaw, dysphonia, dysphagia, lip injury, tongue injury, or tooth damage.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients undergo flexible scope intubation up to 2 attempts following induction of general anesthesia and adequate manual ventilation. In case of failed 2 attempts, patients undergo a third attempt utilizing another technique or device.\n\nARM B: Patients undergo flexible scope intubation and video laryngoscopy up to 2 attempts following induction of general anesthesia and adequate manual ventilation. In case of failed 2 attempts, patients undergo a third attempt utilizing another technique or device."
