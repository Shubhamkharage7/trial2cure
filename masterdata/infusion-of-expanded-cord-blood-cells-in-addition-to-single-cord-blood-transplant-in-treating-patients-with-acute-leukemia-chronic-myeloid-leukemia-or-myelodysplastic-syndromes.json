            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well donor umbilical cord blood transplant with ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells (dilanubicel) works in treating patients with blood cancer. Before the transplant, patients will receive chemotherapy (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and in some cases thiotepa) and radiation therapy. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive either regimen A or regimen B.\n\nREGIMEN A: Patients (10 through 45 years old) receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -8 to -6 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6. Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -4 to -1. Patients receive unmanipulated cord blood unit IV followed by dilanubicel IV within the next 24 hours on day 0.\n\nREGIMEN B: Patients (10 through 65 years old) receive fludarabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days -6 to -3 and IV over 30 minutes on day -2, cyclophosphamide IV on day -6, and thiotepa IV over 2-4 hours on days -5 and -4. Patients undergo TBI once daily (QD) on days -2 and -1. Patients receive unmanipulated cord blood unit IV followed by dilanubicel IV within the next 24 hours on day 0.\n\nAll patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy as clinically indicated during screening and on study. Patients undergo multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiography (ECHO), and computed tomography (CT) during screening. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 180 days, 1 year, and 2 years."
