            "briefSummary": "TheraPAP is a prototype device (with full documented electrical and isolation safety) being developed by SleepRes for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that can deliver either standard CPAP at a set pressure or what is called TPAP . TPAP is a pressure control algorithm that lowers the pressure from the set pressure at the beginning of inspiration and does not return the pressure to the full set level until about halfway through expiration. The present study, TheraPAP Comfort, aims at assessing whether TPAP improves patient comfort vs. CPAP during supine wakefulness.",
            "detailedDescription": "The TheraPAP Comfort Study is an in-office study to assess comfort of TPAP vs. CPAP in CPAP-na\u00efve patients with OSA during supine wakefulness. Patients will be recruited after routine outpatient visits. They will be asked to breath normally for approximately 1 minute in supine wakefulness while being administered background CPAP (at 9 or 13 cmH2O) or TPAP at various pressure drops. TPAP drops will be administered in a paired comparison before or/and after each corresponding CPAP level, according to a randomized design. Eventually, 6 one-to-one comparisons (TPAP vs. corresponding background CPAP or TPAP vs. TPAP) will be made, 3 per each randomized order. As an example, CPAP 9 will be compared to TPAP 1/1 cmH2O drops; CPAP 9 will be compared to TPAP 2/2 cmH2O drops; and TPAP 1/1 cmH2O drops will be compared to TPAP 2/2 cmH2O drops in a random sequence."
