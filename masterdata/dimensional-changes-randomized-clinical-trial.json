            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the dimensional changes in the short and long-term in patients with thin gum tissues who have gum grafts placed on either denuded bone or gum grafts placed on a bone with some tissues remaining.\n\nThe main question this study aims to answer is:\n\n- Does the placement of free-epithelized gingival grafts (gum grafts) on full thickness bed preparation (having all of the tissue removed from the bone) lead to similar clinical, digital, and patient-related outcomes and measurements over a period of 12 months versus split thickness bed preparation (where a small layer of tissue is left over the bone) in patients with thin gum tissue phenotypes (gum tissue is generally less than 1.5 millimeters) who are in need of soft tissue augmentation procedures?\n\nParticipants will be asked to attend 8 visits, which include: (i) screening visit, (ii) prophylaxis visit, (iii) random assignment to Group A or Group B along with surgery and digital data collection, (iv) 2-week post-operative visit, (v) 6-week post-operative visit, (vi) 3-month follow-up visit, (vii) 6-month follow-up visit, (viii) 12-month follow-up visit. Also, Group A will have a free epithelialized gingival/mucosal graft (gum graft) placed on full thickness periosteal bed preparation where all of the tissue was removed (test group). Group B will have a free epithelialized gingival/mucosal graft (gum graft) on split thickness periosteal bed preparation where only a portion of the tissue was removed (control group). Researchers will compare Group A and Group B to see if there is a difference in clinical, digital, and patient-related outcomes and measurements over a period of 12 months."
