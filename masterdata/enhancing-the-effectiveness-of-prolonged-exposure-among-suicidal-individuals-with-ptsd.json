            "briefSummary": "The long-term goal of this study is to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors among treatment-seeking individuals who also have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prolonged exposure (PE) and crisis response plan (CRP) have demonstrated empirical support for reducing suicide attempts as compared to treatment as usual. However, no studies to date have assessed their effectiveness when used in combination. In light of this knowledge gap, the primary objective of this study will be to test the effectiveness of PE augmented with CRP as compared to PE with care as usual (self-guided treatment plan), an active comparator, for the reduction of suicide ideations and attempts for individuals with comorbid PTSD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with a host of functional problems and negative outcomes, including occupational and marital dissatisfaction, violence, alcohol and substance abuse, and suicide. Cognitive behavioral treatments tend to be the most highly efficacious treatments for PTSD. Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is a manualized cognitive behavioral therapy consisting of imaginal exposure followed by processing thoughts and feelings related to the imaginal experience; in-vivo exposure, psychoeducation, and controlled breathing training. Preliminary evidence suggests that PE is associated with significant suicidal ideation (SI) reductions. Enhancing PE with procedures that have been shown to significantly reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors could serve to further reduce suicide risk during and after treatment completion.\n\nThe long-term goal of this project is to prevent suicides among individuals diagnosed with PTSD by integrating trauma-focused therapies with suicide-focused interventions. The primary objective of this pilot project is to test the efficacy of PE when enhanced with a crisis response plan utilizing self-report, behavioral, and ecological assessment methods to compare treatment effects."

The CRP also includes a section focused on the participant's reasons for living, an addition that has been shown to increase positive emotional states (e.g., hope, optimism) and lead to faster reductions in suicidal intent.
