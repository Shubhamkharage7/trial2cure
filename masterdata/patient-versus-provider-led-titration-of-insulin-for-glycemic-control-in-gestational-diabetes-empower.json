            "briefSummary": "We propose a pragmatic, unblinded, randomized controlled, single center trial of 56 pregnant individuals with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Our study proposes a pragmatic randomized control trial of patient led rapid titration of basal insulin compared to standard therapy. There is a planned subgroup analysis of patients with and without concomitant metformin usage. Patients will continue routine clinic visits. Patients who are initiated on basal insulin or started on night-time basal insulin within 7 days will be approached about the study. Patients who agree to be enrolled will sign informed consent.",
            "detailedDescription": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent medical complications of pregnancy and affects nearly 1 in 10 pregnant individuals. GDM is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the pregnant individual (cesarean delivery, preeclampsia) and infant (large for gestational age at birth, preterm birth \\<37 weeks, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia). Improved glycemic control has been associated with reduction in the risks of these adverse pregnancy outcomes. Nearly 1 in 4 pregnant individuals with GDM will require medication to achieve glycemic control. The first-line therapy historically recommended for glycemic control is insulin and continues to be the primary recommendation of guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA). However current guidelines do not recommend a clear approach to insulin titration in GDM. This is an important limitation of current clinical practice. Individuals with GDM who are generally diagnosed between 24 to 28 weeks only have a short window of up to a few months to achieve glycemic control with pharmacotherapy to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Traditionally, provider led titration of insulin has been the standard of care. Recommendations from outside of pregnancy and limited observational data from pregnancy have proposed patient-led self-titration of basal insulin have improved glycemic control compared to provider led titration.\n\nWe propose to conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial \"EMPOWER: Patient versus provider-led titration of basal insulin for glycemic control in gestational diabetes\" to compare pregnant individuals with GDM diagnosed \\>20 weeks gestation randomized to patient-led (intervention) versus provider-led insulin titration (standard of care).\n\nOVERALL AIM: To conduct a pragmatic, non-blinded randomized controlled trial (pRCT) of patient-led insulin titration versus provider-led titration of basal insulin to improve glycemic control in the late third trimester in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes.\n\n1.2 Specific Aims\n\nPRIMARY AIM:\n\nCompare glycemic control defined as the mean fasting glucose in the last week prior to term (36 weeks) between individuals randomized to patient-led (intervention) versus provider-led insulin titration (standard of care).\n\nSECONDARY AIMS:\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Compare the frequency of adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, large for gestational age, and NICU admission) between individuals randomized to patient-led (intervention) versus provider-led insulin titration (standard of care).\n\nSecondary Aim 2: Compare effect of concurrent metformin use on total daily insulin dose per kilogram at 36 weeks overall, and by patient-led (intervention) versus provider-led insulin titration.\n\nSecondary Aim 3: Compare patient and provider satisfaction between patient-led (intervention) versus provider-led insulin titration."
