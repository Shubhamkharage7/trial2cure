            "briefSummary": "This research study proposes to quantify the efficacy of the novel high intensity body-weight circuit (HIBC) training intervention on metabolic profile, body composition, and health related fitness exercise in middle aged persons with type-2 diabetes (T2DM); and secondarily, compare these outcomes to that of a traditional exercise intervention (TEI). This research project is extremely relevant to public health, in that prevalence of T2DM continues to rise on a national and global scale, placing a heavy economic cost on both the healthcare industry and the individual patient in an age-dependent fashion. Results of this study may provide an effective and appealing alternative exercise intervention for cardiometabolic disease management in adults with T2DM, and have significant clinical and public health applications."

The exercise sessions will involve repeating a series of repetitions of each movement in sequence, and completing as many sequences as possible in good form in the time allotted for the exercise (initially, 5 minutes). Three sessions per week will be completed at home. After three weeks of training, participants will be asked to add a fourth session each week. Initially, the HIBC sessions will be five minutes long, and the duration of the sessions will increase by one minute each week as tolerated beginning in week four, peaking at 10-minutes per session (warm up not included in this timing) as early as the eighth week of training. Session duration will be capped at 10-minutes.",

Modified Rows: participants will grab the bands with arms and legs extended. They will find a comfortable angle by which to perform a \"row\" (pulling the handles to the rib cage) with arms at a 45-degree angle. Modified Push-Ups: perform push-ups on their knees with a flat back and hands underneath their shoulders.
