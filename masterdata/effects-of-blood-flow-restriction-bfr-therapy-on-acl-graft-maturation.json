BFR therapy will begin as early as 2 weeks after surgery. The initial 2 weeks after surgery, or prior to initiation of BFR, will consist of the physical therapy following the surgeon's postoperative protocol.\n\nTo be considered for participation in this study, patients must be 18 years and older undergoing primary ACL reconstruction. In addition, patients must meet several inclusion/exclusion criteria to be randomized and included in this study."
