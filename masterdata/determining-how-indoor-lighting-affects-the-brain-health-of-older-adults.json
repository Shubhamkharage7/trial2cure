            "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized, cross-over, single-site trial followed by an exploratory third intervention is to understand how indoor lighting affects different measures of brain health in older adults living in independent living residences. This is a community based study occurring in a local senior living facility. The main question this study aims to answer is:\n\n- How does the quality of ambient indoor lighting an older adult is exposed to affect measures of brain health, such as sleep quality, physical activity, cognitive function, and social engagement?\n\nParticipants will be exposed to three different indoor lighting conditions for 4 weeks each while performing the following tasks:\n\n* Wear a smartwatch throughout the study to measure sleep quality and physical activity\n* Wear a small, wearable light sensor to measure light exposure during waking hours\n* Perform cognitive assessments throughout the study to detect any changes between each of the lighting conditions\n* Complete self-report of surveys to assess independence, social engagement, sleep quality, and mood\n\nResults from these tasks will be compared within and between subjects to assess whether the different lighting conditions affect these different measures of brain health."
