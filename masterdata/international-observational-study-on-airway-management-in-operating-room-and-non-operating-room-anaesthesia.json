            "briefSummary": "According to WHO, more than 230 million major surgical procedures are carried out under general anaesthesia each year worldwide. Despite important technological advances, airway management remains a major challenge in anaesthesiology. Data from large perspective studies on current incidence of major peri-intubation adverse events are lacking in the anaesthesia setting, especially on outcomes such as peri-intubation cardiovascular collapse, severe hypoxemia, and cardiac arrest. These events are more common in case of difficulties with airway management so that first pass intubation failure significantly increase the risks. Moreover, it has been documented that even transient hypotension during general anaesthesia, may have long-term consequences and may be associated with a worse outcome in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The primary aim of the study is to assess the current incidence of major peri-intubation adverse events during anaesthesia in patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery and in the setting of nonoperating room anesthesia. The secondary aim is to assess the current practice of airway management during anesthesia worldwide.\n\nSTARGATE Study will be a large international observational study recruiting all consecutive adult (\u2265 18 years old) patients undergoing general anesthesia in operating room and outside operating room. Primary outcome will be a composite of cardiovascular collapse, cardiac arrest and severe hypoxemia.",
