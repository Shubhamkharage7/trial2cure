            "briefSummary": "The 1100 study is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation and expansion prospective clinical study to assess the safety of intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "The 1100 study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy in three cohorts of patients in dose escalation and expansion parts. The Escalation Cohort 1 includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the injectable lesion in a previously irradiated field. In Escalation Cohorts 2 and 3, patients present with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nThe Expansion cohort 1 includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the injectable lesion located either in head and neck area or in lung or liver, who are resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. The Expansion cohort 2 includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the injectable lesion located either in head and neck area or in lung or liver, who are naive to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nThe Expansion Cohort 3 includes patients with inoperable NSCLC, malignant melanoma, HCC, RCC, urothelial cancer, cervical cancer or TNBC with metastases to lungs, liver or soft tissue and who are resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nThese patients have a high unmet need and the Sponsor hypothesizes that NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will act synergistically with anti-PD-1 to enhance the therapeutic index of radiotherapy maximizing local effect, to overcome radio-resistance, to increase the local efficacy of immunotherapy, and to improve distant tumor control via an abscopal effect. Eligible patients will receive a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 subsequently activated by radiotherapy and then an approved anti-PD-1. The end of treatment visit will take place 4 weeks after the last radiotherapy fraction. Patients will be followed for long-term safety and efficacy for 2 years after the EOT visit."
