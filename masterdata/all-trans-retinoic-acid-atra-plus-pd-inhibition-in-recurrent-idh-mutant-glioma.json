The Sponsor-Investigator hypothesizes that the proposed regimen will be safe and stimulate a robust anti-tumor immune response.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study has a Safety Run-In, a Phase 2 Portion, and a Surgical Portion. The Phase 2 portion and Surgical portion will open to enrollment simultaneously following successful completion of the Safety Run-In.\n\nSafety Run-In subjects receive 28-day cycles of treatment, with ATRA 45mg/m2/day given orally in two equally divided doses on days 1-14 and retifanlimab 500mg IV on day 1. Once Safety Run-In is complete, the Phase 2 and Surgical cohorts will commence uninterrupted.\n\nPhase 2: All Phase 2 patients will receive 28-day cycles of treatment, with ATRA 45mg/m2/day given orally in two equally divided doses on days 1 through 14 and retifanlimab 500mg IV on day 1.\n\nArm A includes alkylator-refractory patients at high risk for progression of disease, having failed temozolomide and another alkylating agent. At the first stage, 12 subjects will be enrolled onto the study. This arm of the trial will be stopped if no response was obtained among the first 12 subjects (0/12). Otherwise, this arm of the study will continue to stage Four additional subjects will be enrolled on the second stage of this arm of the trial.\n\nArm B includes patients who have failed only one prior alkylating chemotherapy regimen and have gone at least 12 months since the last treatment (chemotherapy or radiation therapy), i.e., favorable risk patients. At the first stage, 14 subjects will be enrolled onto the study. This arm of the trial will be stopped if 5 or fewer responses were obtained among the first 14 subjects greater than or equal to 5 out of 14 subjects. Otherwise, this arm of the study will continue to stage 2. Three additional subjects will be enrolled on the second stage of this arm of the trial.\n\nSurgical Portion: This portion of the study will enroll patients who are eligible for re-resection at the time of recurrence. Prior to surgical resection, patients are randomized 1:1 to receive either 1) single-agent ATRA 45mg/m2/day orally in two equally divided doses for 14 days pre-surgery (Arm C), or 2) the combination of ATRA 45mg/m2/day orally in two equally divided doses for 14 days pre-surgery plus a 500mg IV dose of retifanlimab 14 (+/-3) days prior to the date of surgery (Arm D). At surgery fresh tumor tissue will be collected for correlative studies. Following surgery all patients will receive 28-day cycles of treatment, with ATRA 45mg/m2/day given orally in two equally divided doses on days 1-14 and retifanlimab 500mg IV on day 1."

Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression in excess of physiologic maintenance doses of corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent).\n\n   * Physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy at doses \u2264 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency and in the absence of active autoimmune disease is permitted.\n   * Participants with asthma that requires intermittent use of bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or local corticosteroid injections may participate.\n   * Participants using topical, ocular, intra-articular, or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) may participate.\n   * Brief courses of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or study treatment-related standard premedications are permitted.\n\n   EXCEPTIONS: Patients with the following autoimmune diseases may participate: type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, Grave's disease that is previously treated with thyroidectomy or radioiodine, celiac disease with symptoms controlled with a gluten-free diet.\n9. Evidence of interstitial lung disease, history of interstitial lung disease, or active, noninfectious pneumonitis.\n10. Immune related toxicity during prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy for which permanent discontinuation of therapy was recommended (per product label or consensus guidelines) or any immune-related toxicity requiring intensive or prolonged immunosuppression to manage (with the exception of endocrinopathy that is well controlled on replacement hormones).\n11. Known active hepatitis B virus (HBsAg reactive) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV RNA detectable by PCR)\n12. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy\n13. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are excluded from this trial. Otherwise, patients with prior or concurrent malignancy are eligible.\n14. Any serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease, or active, uncontrolled infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at undue risk from the study treatment.\n15. Patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease including, but not limited to, any of the following are ineligible:\n\n    * Myocardial infarction or uncontrolled angina within 90 days prior to consent\n    * History of clinically significant arrhythmia (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes)\n    * History of cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, significant pericardial effusion, myocarditis, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV congestive heart failure\n16. Known hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody that cannot be controlled with standard measures (e.g., antihistamines and corticosteroids)\n17. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of retifanlimab or formulation components.\n18. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin), any of its components, or other retinoids\n19. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated\n20. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness\n21. Pregnant women are excluded\n22. Has received a live vaccine within 28 days before the planned start of study treatment\n\n    Note: Examples of live vaccines include but are not limited to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella-zoster (chickenpox), yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccines. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed-virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines are live, attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n23.
