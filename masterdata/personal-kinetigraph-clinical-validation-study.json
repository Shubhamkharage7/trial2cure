The PKG System is intended to quantify kinematics of movement disorder symptoms in conditions such as Parkinson's disease, including tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia. This study aims to clinically validate new PKG assessments such as walking, Device Assisted Therapy readiness, Percent Time Bradykinesia, Percent Time Dyskinesia, fall prediction, disease progression and non-motor. The clinical validation will require enrollment of both subjects with a diagnosis of movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease, and healthy control subjects who do not a neurological disorder."
