            "detailedDescription": "In this study, urinary stone disease patients will be recruited from the Park City Urology Clinic at Intermountain Healthcare.\n\nSubjects will undergo screening and baseline assessments, including a history and physical exam. A 24-hour urine sample will be collected. Urinary parameters include analysis for calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, NH4, sulfate, pH, Cr, phosphate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, super saturation (SS) CaOx, SSUA, SSCaP, UUN.\n\nMicrobial Transplant Therapy (MTT), the intervention, will be offered to individuals who produce greater than 60% calcium-oxalate stones. Pathology reports in the patient's medical record will be used to confirm the stone composition. The cohort of 36 total enrollees will be comprised of four separate study groups. The first group of 12 will include hyperoxaluric patients, the second group of 12 will include hypercalciuric patients, the third group will enroll six patients with hyperoxaluria as a control group, and the fourth group will enroll six patients with hypercalciuria as a control group. Grouping will be determined by 24-hour urine analysis which show measurements of urinary calcium \\>225mg/day (hypercalciuric group) and oxalate \\>40mg/day (hyperoxaluric group).\n\nStool samples will be obtained for metagenomic analyses prior to the intervention.\n\nSubjects will be assigned to the hypercalciuric and hyperoxaluric arms based upon urine parameters or placed in the control arm by random assignment. Because antibiotic treatment is common during surgery for stones, participants will be treated with 3 days of vancomycin 500 mg orally twice a day and neomycin 1,000 mg orally twice a day. This treatment is for all subjects, rather than only for subjects with recent or planned urological intervention; in order for the MTT to take hold, all patients must be treated with antibiotics. Twenty-four hours later, participants will take either the control capsule or the microbial capsules, 2 capsules daily for 7 days."
