Patients scheduled for lumbar medial branch blocks as part of routine clinical care will arrive to clinic prior to the block for quantitative sensory testing procedures that measure CNS pain modulation. Patients will then undergo treatment as usual with their block, subsequently reporting low back pain intensity in a pain diary."
