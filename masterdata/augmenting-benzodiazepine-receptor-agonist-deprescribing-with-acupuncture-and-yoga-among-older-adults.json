            "briefSummary": "The main purpose of this 12-week study is to see if a new combination of treatments can help older adults reduce benzodiazepine or related medication use. The treatment combination consists of 1) medical provider visits to gradually reduce the medication dose over 12 weeks, 2) acupuncture treatments, and 3) private yoga classes. Participants will be offered weekly visits for 12 weeks to receive combined treatments. Participants will be provided surveys before, during, and after the study to learn about their experience of the treatments. At the end of the study, participants will be invited to participate in a focus group to learn about their experience in the study.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study consists of a single-arm clinical study among 30 older adults taking benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (BRZA) to assess the feasibility of protocol-driven BRZA deprescribing augmented with combined acupuncture and yoga. Adults 65 years or older that are taking BRZA will be recruited. Deprescribing will be provided at weekly visits with a psychiatric nurse practitioner at the Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Participants will receive acupuncture and yoga from a staff acupuncturist and yoga instruction from a yoga instructor at the Osher Center. Feasibility of study enrollment will occur through the study enrollment period. Feasibility of study treatments will be evaluated during and after study treatment delivery. Feasibility of study outcome assessments will occur at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Throughout the research process, investigators will engage a Stakeholder Advisory Panel consisting of patients and clinicians."
