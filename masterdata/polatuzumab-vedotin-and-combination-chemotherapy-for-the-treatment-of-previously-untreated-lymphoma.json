            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well polatuzumab vedotin and combination chemotherapy work in treating patients with previously untreated double, triple hit lymphoma, Double Expressor Lymphoma or High-Grade B Cell Lymphoma. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding with cancer cells and releasing another chemotherapy drug, called monomethyl auristatin E, into the cell causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving polatuzumab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with double or triple hit lymphoma compared to combination chemotherapy alone.",

Male patients considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before study treatment\n* CRITERIA FOR TISSUE SUBMISSION:\n* Eligible patients must have available at the study site a representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis of DLBCL\n\n  * The specimen must contain adequate evaluable tumor cells (\\>= 20% for excisional biopsy and \\>= 50% if sample is a core biopsy) to enable relevant biomarker analysis\n  * A tissue block (preferred) or 15 serial, freshly cut, unstained slides plus punch biopsy of the tissue block accompanied by an associated pathology report will be requested. Punch biopsy is required only with the slide submission. Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable\n  * If the archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient on the basis of the above criteria, the patient may still be eligible if the patient is willing to provide tissue from a pretreatment core or excisional/incisional biopsy of the tumor. Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable. The sample should be shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory manual. Tissue collected on study will not be returned to sites. If needed, additional slides from previously collected samples may be requested. Cases received from each of the participating institutes should be histological confirmed according to the 2016 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm. The evaluation process by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) requires the possession of representative amount of tissues in a paraffin embedded block to be sent to the primary testing institution (Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, Michigan). Shipped slides should be placed in proper containers to avoid breakage during shipping. Blocks of paraffin embedded tissue or slides should be sent with a tracking number the address. In addition, the participation institution should call the laboratory at 313-576-8351 (Julie Boerner) for any sample that they ship and provide tracking number\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication to any of the individual components of R-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, prednisone (CHOP) or any component of PoV, including prior receipt of anthracyclines or history of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins) or known sensitivity or allergy to murine products\n* Contraindication to rituximab or prior administration of an anti CD 20 antibody\n* Treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, or any investigational agent for the purposes of treating cancer prior to cycle 1 day 1 with the following exceptions:\n\n  * One prior treatment cycle of CHOP+R is allowed.
