            "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies how well a telehealth self-management program works in improving survivorship care and outcomes in stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer survivors. Survivor self-management program focuses on coaching patients on follow-up care after cancer treatments. Participating in the program may improve knowledge and confidence about follow-up care, communication with cancer care and primary care doctors, and quality of life after cancer treatment in non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer survivors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care coordination, communication, and primary care provider (PCP) knowledge, comparing the intervention and attention control arms at 4 and 8 months post-accrual.\n\nII. Determine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes, comparing the intervention and attention control arms at 4 and 8 months post-accrual.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the intervention.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (SURVIVOR SELF-MANAGEMENT): Patients receive a personalized care plan/resource manual. Patients also participate in 5 telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 4 months (months 1-4) about self-management skills building, then 3 maintenance telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 3 months (months 5-7) for additional self-management skills building support. A copy of patient's care plan is also sent to their PCP.\n\nARM II (ATTENTION CONTROL): Patients receive an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) care plan. Patients also participate in 5 telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 4 months (months 1-4) to review a handbook about life after cancer treatment, then 3 monthly telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 3 months (months 5-7) to answer questions about the handbook. A copy of the ASCO care plan is also sent to their PCP. After study initiation, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 months."
