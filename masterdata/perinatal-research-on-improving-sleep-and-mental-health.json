What is the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) versus digital sleep hygiene education (SHE) for preventing perinatal depression?\n2. Is the effect of digital CBT-I on perinatal depression mediated through prenatal insomnia symptom improvement?\n3. Is the effect of digital CBT-I on perinatal depression moderated by baseline depressive symptom severity?\n\nParticipants will receive one of two sleep programs - SHE or CBT-I. Both involve six weekly online sessions. Participants will complete surveys and interviews until 1 year postpartum."
