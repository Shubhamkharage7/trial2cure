The primary hypothesis is that eRapa decreases the risk of cancer relapse for patients with NMIBC. Secondary hypotheses are that eRapa can improve certain immune parameters and improve cognition and physical function without adversely affecting patient-reported outcomes and quality of life.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a multi-site phase II double-blind randomized trial. Subjects will be randomized into placebo arm or intervention arm with low dose (0.5 mg) eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin) Monday-Friday for one year or until disease recurrence. Patients will undergo endoscopic evaluation of the bladder every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, and at year 5. Some patients may also concurrently receive BCG immune therapy maintenance (weekly for 6 weeks for induction period, weekly for 3 weeks at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months for a total of 7 maintenance cycles following tumor removal) per standard of care. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments, cognitive assessments, and physical assessments will be completed according to the study calendar. Research blood to assess safety, immune response and rapamycin level will be collected regularly throughout the study period. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years following enrollment."

Women/ men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of \"reproductive potential\" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. Examples of effective contraception include hormonal contraception, double barrier method (condom with spermicidal cream, diaphragms with spermicidal cream, or condoms with diaphragms), Intrauterine device, and/or partner vasectomy. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures. Both male and female patients will be required to disclose contraception method during screening and agree to continue to use that contraception method through the end of their participation in the study.\n* Patients must have had all grossly visible papillary tumors removed within 90 days prior to registration or cystoscopy confirming no grossly visible papillary tumors within 90 days prior to registration.\n* Patients with T1 disease must have cross-sectional imaging of abdomen/pelvis demonstrating no evidence of nodal involvement or metastatic disease (MRI or CT scan) within 90 days prior to registration. Patients with T1 disease must have re-resection confirming \u2264 T1 disease within 90 days prior to registration.\n* Patients must no have received prior intravesical BCG\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have muscle-invasive or higher (\u2265T2) bladder cancer\n* Unable to give informed consent\n* Age 17 or younger\n* Taking oral glucocorticoids at the time of registration\n* Another cancer requiring active treatment (except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin)\n* Patients at risk of pregnancy that are unwilling or unable to take effective contraception during the study period, or patients that are nursing during the study period. Women/ Men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method or will be considered ineligible for study participation.\n* Evidence of nodal involvement or metastatic disease (MRI or CT scan) within 90 days prior to registration\n* History of prior intravesical BCG\n* History of prior Rapamycin treatment",
