The investigators also want to know if these processes are associated with drinking alcohol.\n\nParticipation includes three study visits of about 2 hours each over approximately a month. The first visit involves a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and answering survey questions. Each of the next two visits will involve a session of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, a non-invasive brain stimulation technique) followed by another MRI scan.\n\nPeople in the Auburn/Opelika area 19 or older are eligible to participate. People who drink alcohol and people who do not drink or don't drink very much are invited to participate."
