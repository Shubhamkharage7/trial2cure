Ongoing data collection for research purposes is vital to the long-term assessment as to the safety of the procedure and accompanying immunosuppression protocol, as well as quantifying patient outcomes and changes in quality of life. For these reasons, The Johns Hopkins Hand/Arm Transplantation Team is interested in enrolling transplanted patients in a follow-up protocol to continue collecting informative data to further the field of vascularized composite allotransplantation."
