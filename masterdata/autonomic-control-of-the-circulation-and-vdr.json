            "briefSummary": "The study objective of this project is to examine the mechanisms of the venous distension reflex (VDR) in humans. We hypothesize that COX blockade with ketorolac tromethamine, an intravenous NSAID, will attenuate the muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) response to limb venous distension. To gain further insight into whether the COX byproducts directly stimulate chemically-sensitive afferents, or enable venodilation and indirectly evoke afferent stimulation, we will measure vein size using 3T MRI during venous distention with and without ketorolac infusions.",
            "detailedDescription": "We will use a prospective observational design to examine if a COX blockade will inhibit the MSNA response to venous distension (Aim1), and if a COX blockade will alter vein sizes during venous distension (Aim2). Each subject will serve as their own control.\n\nAim 1:\n\nAn IV will be inserted in the antecubital fossa of one arm, and the wrist-to-elbow occlusion will be performed.\n\nTo block the COX system, 6 mg ketorolac tromethamine in 10 ml saline will be infused into the forearm over 1 minute (Infusion 1). After 10 minutes, a second infusion of ketorolac tromethamine (up to 3 mg) in 5% of the forearm volume of saline,( \\~40-60 ml) will be infused into the occluded forearm at a rate of \\~ 30 ml/min (Infusion 2). Five minutes of data will then be collected before releasing the upper arm cuff. Infusion 1 is to block the COX pathway, while infusion 2 is to induce venous distension.\n\nIn the saline control trial, saline (without ketorolac) in identical volumes as those in the COX blockade trial will be performed on a separate day.\n\nAim 2:\n\nThe subject will lie supine inside the MRI scanner. The subject will be instrumented with cuffs for the wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure on one arm, and cuffs for automated BP and HR measurements from the other arm, The images will be obtained before and during the wrist-to-elbow occlusion procedure. The sizes of veins (i.e. cross sectional area) will be measured offline."

Multiunit recordings of MSNA in the leg will be obtained by transcutaneous placement of a tungsten microelectrode (insulated 200 ?m diameter with a tapered un-insulated 1-5 ?m tip) into C-fiber containing fascicle in the nerve. The electrode will be manipulated to yield a neurogram with characteristic bursts of MSNA, that will be amplified, filtered, rectified and integrated to obtain a mean voltage neurogram. Analysis consists of counting burst frequency and amplitude.",
