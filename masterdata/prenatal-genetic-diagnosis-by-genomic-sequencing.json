            "briefSummary": "This study is evaluating the impact of prenatal sequencing on the management of fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities. The hypothesis is that a significant subset of fetal abnormalities have a genetic cause that can be identified by sequencing and that prenatal knowledge of this information will improve prenatal care, reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing, reduce the cost of care, and improve the quality of life for both the child and the family.",
            "detailedDescription": "Whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WGS) have expanded the ability to determine the genetic etiology of previously undiagnosed disorders. This study is a multicenter prospective cohort study to evaluate the emerging technology of sequencing for the management of fetuses with structural anomalies. The hypothesis is that a significant subset of fetal structural anomalies has a genetic etiology identifiable by sequencing and that prenatal knowledge of this information will improve perinatal care, reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing, reduce the cost of care, and improve quality of life for both the child and the family. The aims of this study are to investigate these multiple aspects of prenatal sequencing in a single study with an innovative integrated prospective design, which will permit a robust evaluation of the benefits and risks of delivering diagnostic and prognostic genetic testing results in a prenatal setting.\n\nThe study will determine, in a sequential population of pregnancies with selected fetal structural anomalies and a negative or non-causal chromosomal microarray (CMA), the frequency of pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and uncertain genomic variants identifiable by sequencing. To determine the impact of this information on clinical care, a control population of unsequenced pregnancies with similar structural anomalies will be prospectively recruited and the infants from both cohorts will be followed up to 1 year of age. This study component will evaluate differences in healthcare management and cost through discharge from hospital post-delivery, and perinatal and infant outcomes through 1 year of life. The educational, counseling and psychosocial impact of sequencing results during the prenatal period, in the nursery and through 1 year of life also will be evaluated. Since the analytical and clinical tools needed for the full translation of sequencing into care are still developing, optimization of bioinformatic tools to improve identification of pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations associated with prenatal phenotypes of established disease genes will be investigated, as well as identification of new genes associated with presently undiagnosed fetal/neonatal phenotypes. This study will provide an in-depth evaluation of the prenatal diagnostic value of sequencing prior to its responsible introduction into practice and will provide independent data to guide its translation."
