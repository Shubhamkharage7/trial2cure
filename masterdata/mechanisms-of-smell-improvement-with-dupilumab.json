The investigators expect this study to provide convincing evidence that dupilumab improves clinical olfaction via direct reduction in olfactory cleft inflammation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Post-marketed administration of dupilumab (FDA approved medication for CRSwNP) in patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) will result in significant improvement in objective measures of olfactory cleft inflammation and psychophysical olfaction. The investigators seek to explore the mechanism through which dupilumab improves olfactory cleft inflammation in patients with CRSwNP. The investigators also want to determine whether change in olfactory cleft inflammation correlates with improvement in olfaction (one of the cardinal symptoms of CRSwNP) at 3 months. The investigators hypothesize that after 3 months of treatment with dupilumab, non-inflammatory factors will explain a significant degree of variation in residual clinical olfaction. Additionally, the investigators want to explore the determinants of ongoing olfactory loss after 3 months of treatment with attention to non-inflammatory factors. The investigators expect this study to provide convincing evidence that dupilumab improves clinical olfaction via direct reduction in olfactory cleft inflammation. Specifically, the investigators expect to show that reduction in olfactory cleft inflammation is the result of reduction in IL13 levels in olfactory cleft mucus. Finally, the investigators expect to show that most of the variation in post-treatment olfaction can be explained by non-inflammatory measures that are independent of CRSwNP."
