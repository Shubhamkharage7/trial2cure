Guerin, and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMistR) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n7. Prior genetically modified T or NK cell therapy.\n8. Has diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent).\n9. History of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been completed with no evidence of malignancy for 2 years. The time requirement does not apply to patients who underwent successful definitive resection of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other in situ cancers.\n10. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is allowed.\n11. History of interstitial lung disease (ILD) that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ILD.\n12. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n13. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n14. Known active or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection.\n15. Known history of active tuberculosis (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis).\n16. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participants to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n17. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study.\n18. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n19. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease within 12 months prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, including New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability. NOTE: medically controlled arrhythmia would be permitted if meet criteria per Appendix X.\n20. Prolongation of corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula to \\>480 milliseconds, unless cleared after cardiology evaluation.\n21. Participant with bleeding or thrombotic disorders or at risk for severe hemorrhage.
