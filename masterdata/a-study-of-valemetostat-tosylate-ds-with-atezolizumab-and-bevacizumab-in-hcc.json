            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be started on valemetostat (DS-3201) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, restaging scans will be performed every 9 weeks. The treatment will be continued until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Paired research biopsies will be performed.\n\nThis study will enroll up to approximately 45-patients at UAB. It is estimated 2 patients will be enrolled per month over up to 36 months period.\n\nPatients will receive valemetostat (DS-3201) orally daily at their assigned dose level, plus atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on day 1 of each cycle. Each cycle is 21 days. Atezolizumab and bevacizumab will be administered based on institutional guidelines and practice at the FDA approved dosages and intervals for advanced HCC. Valemetostat should be taken immediately prior to the start of atezolizumab and bevacizumab infusion on day 1 of each cycle."

History of intra-abdominal inflammatory process within 6 months prior to initiation of study treatment, including but not limited to peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, or colitis\n25. Radiotherapy within 28 days and abdominal/ pelvic radiotherapy within 60 days prior to initiation of study treatment, except palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment\n26. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, or abdominal surgery, abdominal interventions or significant abdominal traumatic injury within 60 days prior to initiation of study treatment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study or non-recovery from side effects of any such procedure\n27. Chronic daily treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Occasional use of NSAIDs for the symptomatic relief of medical conditions such as headache or fever is allowed.\n28. Known fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), sarcomatoid HCC, or combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC)\n29. Patients with untreated or incompletely treated varices with bleeding or high-risk for bleeding. Patients must undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and all size of varices (small to large) must be assessed and treated per local standard of care prior to enrollment. Patients who have undergone an EGD within 6 months of prior to initiation of study treatment do not need to repeat the procedure.\n30. History of allogenic organ transplantation.\n31. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease \\[e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease\\], diverticulitis \\[with the exception of diverticulosis\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome \\[granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc\\]). The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    * Patients with vitiligo or alopecia\n    * Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement\n    * Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy\n    * Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the study physician\n    * Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone\n32. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or intracranial metastases\n33. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\n34. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication \u2264 14 days prior to registration. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n    * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\n    * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)\n35. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine \u226430 days prior to registration. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst on study treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.",
