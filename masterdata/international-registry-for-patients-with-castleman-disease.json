The patient registry will obtain real-world demographic, clinical, laboratory, and patient reported outcomes, and treatment data from 1000 patients worldwide with Castleman Disease.\n\nThis registry will help to provide important data for future Castleman Disease research studies. The patient registry helps centralize information on this rare disease, and provides researchers a way to obtain data on Castleman Disease patients. The major objectives for the registry include:\n\n1. Improve our understanding of the natural history (signs, symptoms, laboratory values, survival data, outcome predictors), pathogenesis, and treatment of Castleman disease by collecting a standardized set of demographic and longitudinal data from CD patients,\n2. Build capacity for collaboration between patients, providers, researchers, and industry by collecting clinical data and tracking the location of all available tissue samples for future studies (\"virtual biorepository\"), and\n3. Assemble \"real-world\" data related to burden of disease, treatments used, tolerability, and safety data.\n\nIndividuals affected by Castleman Disease and families of deceased patients are invited to join the registry. The patient registry will have two methods of entry.\n\nPatients located anywhere in the United States of America (USA), Canada, or rest of world will be able to enroll themselves directly into the registry. Participants will enroll online and be asked to provide their electronic medical records to University of Pennsylvania researchers for data extraction. All patients in both groups will also be asked to complete questionnaires every three months about their symptoms, treatments, and experiences with Castleman Disease. Complete participant information will be stored in a secure database.\n\nResearchers who are interested in studying Castleman Disease can also request access to registry datasets."
