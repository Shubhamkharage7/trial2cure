            "briefSummary": "This study is called the Microbes and Respiratory Illnesses (MARI) Study. Children growing up on farms are exposed to many types of microbes that could be beneficial. It is thought that increased exposure to certain types of microbes early in life helps to develop a healthy immune system and reduce the risk for severe common cold illnesses, breathing problems, and allergies.",
            "detailedDescription": "Respiratory viruses, most notably rhinoviruses (RV), commonly infect school-age children during the month of September and are a well-known exposure for asthma exacerbations. Allergic sensitization is a risk factor for increased viral respiratory illness burden and wheezing. Nasal Airway Epithelial Cell (NAEC) responses to viral exposure show distinct transcriptional programs that differ in individuals with allergies or asthma. There is a growing body of evidence strongly suggesting nasal airway microbial communities enriched in several commensal bacteria are associated with protection from symptomatic RV infections. Metagenomic sequencing from previously collected nasal samples obtained at age 2 years showed distinct microbial communities and function in the Plain Community Cohort compared to farm and non-farm children. How the early life nasal microbial community can impact risk for viral respiratory infection symptoms and NAEC biology remains an important and unresolved question. To address this important question, this proposal includes an observational study to identify patterns of nasal airway gene expression among three cohorts of school-age children that markedly differ in their susceptibility to respiratory illnesses and wheezing: children from Plain/Amish communities, suburban children without asthma, and suburban children with asthma."

The family will be given the materials to take home to be able to collect the nasal swab at home and mail it back to the study site.\n* Nasal Filter Paper: Nasal secretions will be collected by inserting an absorbent strip into the child's nose for 1-2 minutes.\n* Saliva (spit)\n* Genetic Testing: Some of the tests performed on the child's saliva and nasal samples will be genetic testing"
