            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to examine changes in pain sensitivity during high fatigue exercise, low fatigue exercise, and no treatment in individuals who are currently experiencing knee pain. Dosing dynamic resistance exercise intensity based on fatigue level is a novel, clinically feasible method. Dynamic resistance exercise at a high intensity (75% 1 repetition maximum (RM)) produces significant hypoalgesia at local sites compared to no treatment; however, dosing intensity based on 1RM can be challenging to implement in the clinical setting. Fatiguing endurance tasks produce local and systemic reductions in pressure pain threshold with low intensity isometric exercise completed until failure resulting in the largest exercise induced hypoalgesia effects. Fatigue may be an important mediator in pain response to exercise."
