In doing so, researchers will have a better understanding of breast cancer, and everyone can potentially benefit from scientific advances and improvements in care.",

The overarching goal of SFC is to create a robust research resource comprised of clinical, biological, socio-behavioral, and other data from up to 200,000 people with breast cancer-including minoritized and historically marginalized people, persons, or communities-to ensure the data, researchers use to study breast cancer, is as diverse as the people touched by this disease.
