            "briefSummary": "Rates of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are rising globally, demanding innovative interventions beyond the scope of current efforts to prevent STIs. The United States Doxycycline Post-exposure Prophylaxis (DoxyPEP) Study has demonstrated the efficacy of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) among men who have sex with men and transgender women; but puzzlingly, doxycycline PEP was found ineffective in cisgender women in the Kenyan doxycycline Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (dPEP) study, with preliminary data suggesting the low medication adherence may explain the null result. By study end, the investigators will have developed adherence measurement methods for doxycycline in hair, blood, and urine, and will use these techniques to help interpret the Kenyan dPEP study, and to examine the relative performance of these methods within the United States DoxyPEP trial, establishing adherence metrics for current and future rollout studies of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis"
