            "briefSummary": "Delayed cord clamping is a routine technique used in the delivery room. The baby remains attached to the umbilical cord and placenta for 30-60 seconds after birth to allow for maximal transfer of oxygen and blood to the newborn. This study seeks to determine the best position (on the back versus on the belly) for the newborn during the 30-60 seconds of delayed cord clamping.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is being done to see if placing babies on the stomach or the back during delayed cord clamping after birth will improve the outcomes of preterm babies. Studies have shown that in some instances, positioning on the belly may help newborns clear their respiratory secretions. Research has shown that preterm babies can have improved breathing and require less support when placed on the stomach (prone position) rather than the back (supine position). Currently there are no guidelines for the best position for neonates to be in while receiving delayed cord clamping. The investigators are hoping to complete a research study to determine if placing preterm babies on their stomachs during the time of delayed cord clamping will improve the breathing of preterm babies and reduce the need for additional oxygen support with a breathing tube (endotracheal intubation). Depending on the outcomes of the study, the investigators are hoping to determine which position results in better outcomes for babies in both the delivery room and in the neonatal intensive care unit. If the investigators are able to determine the optimal position in this study, the investigators hope to improve the outcomes for future babies that are born preterm by placing the baby in the optimal position during delayed cord clamping."
