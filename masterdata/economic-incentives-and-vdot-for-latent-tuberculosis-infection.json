            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel and scalable intervention that combines Video Directly Observed Therapy (vDOT) and financial incentives to promote completion of treatment for latent tuberculosis. Adult participants who are initiating treatment for latent tuberculosis will be recruited from the Baltimore City Health Department. The primary hypothesis is that the incentive intervention will increase the percentage of participants that complete the treatment for latent tuberculosis above the completion rates of participants receiving usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Identifying and treating individuals with latent tuberculosis (TB) (LTBI) is a key strategy to achieve the goal of TB elimination in the US but there are many challenges to achieving this goal. In Baltimore, where this research will be conducted, prior studies suggest 35% of non-US--born individuals may have latent TB. Individuals experiencing homelessness have also been found to be at higher risk for TB infection. However, socioeconomic factors such as poverty, access to care, health literacy, and language or cultural barriers present obstacles to treatment. Treatment for latent TB is rarely a priority for patients with many other competing needs. The length of treatment spans many months, and preliminary data shows that less than half will complete prescribed treatment. To date there are limited interventions shown to be effective in increasing adherence to LTBI therapy. Directly observed therapy (DOT) administered via video (Video-DOT, with case-management) has been shown to be effective at monitoring treatment in active TB, but there is limited data when applied to LTBI. Interventions that provide incentives to patients when they meet required therapeutic goals have been demonstrated extraordinarily effective in promoting therapeutic behavior change in diverse populations.\n\nThe goal of this randomized trial is to evaluate two adherence interventions ( Video DOT or Video DOT plus financial incentives) versus Usual Care to promote completion of treatment for latent TB among those found eligible and are prescribed short course therapy (isoniazid+Rifampin(3HR), Isoniazid+rifapentine(3HP), or Rifampin alone(4R)) for LTBI care.\n\nThe primary assessment of adherence will be treatment completion which is defined as taking 80% of the prescribed doses of medication, as determined by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps (i.e., 10 of 12 doses for participants prescribed weekly doses of rifapentine and isoniazid; 96 of 120 doses for participants prescribed daily doses of rifampin; 67 of 84 doses of daily isoniazid and rifampin\n\nVideo directly observed therapy (video-DOT) will use the Electronic Mobile Comprehensive Health Application (emocha) platform. This system provides a HIPAA compliant approach for remote DOT combined with data collection that optimizes TB case management. The Video DOT system is comprised of a smart phone/tablet application used by patients, and a web-based dashboard used by the TB clinic. The patient-side application (app) reminds patients to take their medications on a schedule specified by the clinician. For those randomized to the Video-DOT plus incentives arm, additional financial incentives (provided in real-time) are delivered contingent on verification of medication ingestion by video observation."
