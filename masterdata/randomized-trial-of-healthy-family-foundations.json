To assess the efficacy of the adapted HFF program with 275 military families from health centers at military bases in Washington, Florida, and Nevada. Families with an active-duty servicemember parent will be randomized to Healthy Family Foundations (HFF) or control condition. Primary outcomes consist of infant weight status (weight-for-length z-score) and maternal postpartum weight retention through 12 months; fathers' change in weight to 12 months is a secondary outcome.\n\nAim 2. To test mediation: HFF will foster healthy (A) parent weight outcomes via mutual parental support around healthy lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, nutrition, sleep); and (B) child weight status via coparenting support for health-related parenting (responsive feeding and promotion of sleep, physical activity, stress regulation).\n\nAim 3. To assess whether baseline parent characteristics (financial stress, mental health, relationship conflict, or weight status) or participant program engagement moderate program effects.\n\nParticipants randomized to the Healthy Family Foundations (HFF) intervention condition will participate in 10 online group classes (5 prenatal and 5 postnatal).\n\nParticipants randomized to the control condition will receive standard of care and opportunities for education at their site.\n\nResearchers will compare the Healthy Family Foundations (HFF) intervention group with a Standard of Care control group to see if there are differences in weight, coparenting support, parent mental health and parent health behaviors."
