Guided by an ecological perspective, the investigators will adapt Living in the Face of Trauma to a mobile platform with GEMA informed intervention targets. The resulting app shall be referred to as NOLA GEM. Our long-term goal is delivering accessible interventions informed by daily experiences that affect health for PLWH. The investigators will test feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the GEMA-informed NOLA GEM app against GEMA alone on adherence and care, and secondary outcomes of mental health and substance use."
