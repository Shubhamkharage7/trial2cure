            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1 study to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of CART123 cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Subjects will be treated with a split dosing approach of CART123 cells (10% Day 0; 30% Day 1; 60% Day 2) for Cohort 1a/1b or a single IV administration of CART123 cells for Cohort 2.\n\nThe total dose administered to each subject will be based on body weight obtained at the time of apheresis. Thus, the target total transduced dose, preceded by lymphodepleting chemotherapy, is 1-2x10\\^6 CART123 cells/kg for Cohort 1a, 5x10\\^6 CART123 cells/kg for Cohort 1b, or 2x10\\^6 CART-123 cells/kg for Cohort 2. The protocol-specified minimum acceptable dose for infusion is 1x10\\^5 CART123 cells/kg for all cohorts.\n\nIt is recommended per routine clinical care, that all subjects with marrow aplasia at Day 28+/-5 undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) as a rescue strategy. If required, this procedure will be performed as part of routine care, outside of the scope of this research study, however subjects will continue to be followed on study. All subjects should therefore have a previously identified stem cell donor in order to participate in this study. Please see Section 6.8 for additional details.\n\nAll subjects will be followed monthly for up to 6 months post the first CART123 cell infusion (Day 0). Thereafter subjects will be transitioned into LTFU for up to 15 years post infusion."

Subjects with signs or symptoms indicative of CNS involvement. A CNS evaluation should be performed as clinically appropriate to rule out CNS involvement.\n8. Known history of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40).\n9. Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association Classification (see Appendix 3).\n10. Patients with a known history or prior diagnosis of optic neuritis or other immunologic or inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system, and unrelated to leukemia or previous leukemia treatment.\n11. Subjects with clinically apparent arrhythmia, or arrhythmias that are not stable on medical management, within 2 weeks of the Screening/Enrollment visit.\n12. Patients with any prior history of myeloproliferative neoplasm.\n13. Patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation by PCR or next generation sequencing.",
