Parts A2 and A3 are optional.\n2. Part B (multiple ascending dose): Part B of the study will include three parts: B1 for non-Asian participants receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, B2 for Japanese participants not receiving statin therapy, and B3 for participants who are receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, with the additional diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and with HbA1c \\< 7.5%. Parts B2 and B3 are optional.\n\nThe study will comprise of:\n\n* A Screening Period of maximum 60 days for both Part A and Part B.\n* Part A: A single dose of AZD1705 with an in-clinic period of 3 days.\n* An outpatient Follow-up Period of approximately 16 weeks.\n* Part B: 2 doses of AZD1705, given 28 days apart with an in-clinic period.\n* An outpatient Follow-up Period of approximately 20 weeks."
