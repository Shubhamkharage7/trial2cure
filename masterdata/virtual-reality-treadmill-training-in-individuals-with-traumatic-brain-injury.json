Participants will be stratified based on age into adults' group or older adults' group and then randomized into the virtual reality treadmill training (intervention) group with feedback or the treadmill training (control) group. This pilot study will also provide preliminary evidence on the impact of the virtual reality treadmill training on mobility, balance, fear of falls, fall risk, attention and physical activity in the community in individuals with TBI. The data collected in this pilot study will also help to estimate sample size for subsequent large clinical trial."
