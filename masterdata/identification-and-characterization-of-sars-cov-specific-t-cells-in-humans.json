            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe higher death rate from COVID-19 in the older population is associated with low CD8 T cell counts in the blood. Researchers want to learn the status of CD8 T cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 and their changes with aging and in COVID-19. This may help to identify why COVID-19 is particularly lethal in the elderly and help to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo identify SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells in humans, and to determine their quantity and quality in people who have recovered from COVID-19.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMaryland residents age 18 and older who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened by phone. They must be able to provide a copy of their positive COVID-19 test result.\n\nParticipants will visit the NIA/Clinical Research Unit. The visit will take about 1 hour.\n\nLaboratory tests showing a positive COVID-19 result will be verified.\n\nParticipants vital signs will be checked. This will include blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respiration. Height and weight will be measured.\n\nParticipants will have a medical history and medicine review. They will complete a COVID-19 questionnaire.\n\nParticipants will have blood drawn. They will give a urine sample.\n\nParticipants will give a saliva sample. They will rinse their mouth with water. After about 3 minutes, they will let saliva pool in the base of their mouth and then spit into a sterile container.\n\nParticipants may be asked if they would be willing to return for optional visits at about 4 months and 1 year later. They will repeat the same laboratory sampling performed at the first visit.\n\n...",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis study is to identify epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by CD8 T cells in the blood of healthy young and old participants as well as COVID-19 recovered. We will also measure general health factors using blood, saliva and urine samples. By analyzing the frequency, differentiation, and expansion of these SARS-CoV-2 recognizing CD8 T cells, we hope to shed light into the T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its change with age and post-infection.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo identify SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells in humans, and to determine their quantity and quality in recovered COVID-19 patients.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: We are investigating the presence or absence of various SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells in healthy adults and in COVID-19 recovered patients to understand the composition of CD8 T cell immunity in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We plan to determine CD8 T cells that are responsive to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSecondary Endpoint: To determine the number and quality of SARSCoV-2 specific CD8"
