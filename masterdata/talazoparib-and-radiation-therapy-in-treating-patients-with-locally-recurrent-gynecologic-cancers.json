            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib in combination with radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with gynecologic cancers that have come back after previous treatment (recurrent). Talazoparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving talazoparib in combination with radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with gynecologic cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of talazoparib combining talazoparib and fractionated radiotherapy in patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, cervical, or vaginal or endometrial carcinoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety profile of talazoparib in combination with fractionated radiotherapy for recurrent gynecologic cancers.\n\nII. To determine a preliminary anti-cancer activity of this combination at the MTD.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the potential feasibility of using biomarkers in tumor tissue, whole blood or serum as predictive markers of treatment response.\n\nII. To explore the impact of talazoparib when combined with radiotherapy for recurrent gynecologic cancers on 1) patient reported acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and 2) overall longitudinal quality of life at week 5 of therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of talazoparib.\n\nPatients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on days -10 to -7 and continuing for up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for up to 7 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6 months for up to 1 year."

Postmenopausal is defined as:\n\n  * Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post menopausal range for women under 50, radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses \\> 1 year ago, chemotherapy-induced menopause with \\> 1 year interval since last menses, or surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\n* Patient of child-bearing potential is willing to adhere to using two forms of highly effective birth control.

Acceptable hormonal methods include: etonogestrel implants (i.e. Implanon, Norplan), normal and low dose combined oral pills, norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (EE) transdermal system, intravaginal device (i.e. EE and etonogestrel) or cerazette (desogestrel). All of these would need to be combined with male condom with spermicide\n* Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up\n* At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as \\>= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \\>= 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements\n* For inclusion in biomarker endpoint, patients must fulfill the following criterion:\n\n  * Provision of informed consent for tumor biopsies \\* If a patient declines to participate in tumor biopsies, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the patient. The patient will not be excluded from other aspects of the study described in this Clinical Study Protocol, so long as they consent to that part\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, hepatic metastases\n* Prior radiotherapy in the region of planned radiotherapy\n* Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy or use of other investigational agents within the 3 weeks prior to start of therapy\n* Previous enrollment in the present study\n* Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 4 weeks\n* Patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \\>= 5 years (will require discussion with study physician)\n* Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy\n* Concomitant use of known CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin and nelfinavir\n* Concomitant use of known P-gp inhibitors (i.e. dronedarone, quinidine, ranolazine, verapamil, ketoconazole, itraconazole), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers (i.e. rifampin, tipranavir, ritonavir), or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors (i.e. elacridar \\[GF120918\\]) should be avoided. If patients are taking any P-gp inhibitors, P-gp inducers, or BRCP inhibitors, they will need to stop them prior to enrolment on the study\n* Persistent toxicities (\\>= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] grade 2) with the exception of alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy\n* Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with corrected QT (QTc) \\> 470 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or family history of long QT syndrome\n* Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia\n* Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 28 days prior to treatment\n* Major surgery within 14 days of starting study treatment and patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery\n* Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, unstable spinal cord compression (untreated and unstable for at least 28 days prior to study entry), superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent\n* Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication\n* Breast feeding women\n* Patients with a known hypersensitivity to talazoparib or any of the excipients of the product\n* Patients with uncontrolled seizures\n* Patients requiring pelvic and para-aortic radiotherapy (defined as levels L1/T12)\n* Patients with isolated vaginal relapse (i.e. no disease in lymph nodes or else where in pelvis/abdomen)",
