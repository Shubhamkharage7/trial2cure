All participants will complete full body composition scans (DEXA) and questionnaires before surgery, prior to physical therapy (three weeks post-op), eight weeks post-op, and 16 weeks post-op. Subjective and objective measures will be taken at physical therapy eight weeks and 16 weeks post-operatively."

Pressure is monitored and regulated continuously to compensate for changing levels in the cuff during movement. Each cuff is specifically designed for the tapered contour of a body limb (arm or leg) and sized appropriately based on body region. These cuffs only work with the Delfi PTS device and allow for comfortable pressure application. Exercise will be performed with the cuff placed around the proximal limb and inflated through the duration of activity (\\~5 minutes), then immediately deflated.",
