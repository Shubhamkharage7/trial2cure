            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the effects of virtual reality use on maximal aerobic exercise test performance (aerobic capacity) in healthy adults. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does using a virtual reality program during a maximal aerobic exercise test lead to differences in VO2peak (maximal aerobic capacity)? and,\n* Does using a virtual reality program during a maximal aerobic exercise test lead to differences in work rate at the ventilatory threshold?\n\nParticipants will complete a maximal aerobic exercise test two times (separated by 1 week of recovery) under the following conditions:\n\n* normal testing conditions in a lab\n* while viewing a virtual reality video\n\nResearchers will compare the test results of both conditions to see if the use of a virtual reality program alters VO2peak or the ventilatory threshold.",
            "detailedDescription": "Virtual reality imparts a dissociative effect on users during exercise, such that the physical activity task is experienced as more enjoyable and pleasant, requires less exertion, and requires less physiological function for a given submaximal work rate.\n\nThis array of positive effects may be particularly advantageous during a maximal aerobic exercise test, mainly because participant motivation and negative psychological state often lead to premature test termination. Ameliorating the unpleasantness of this type of exercise test with the use of virtual reality technology may prolong effort expenditure during the test and result in superior performance compared to a control condition.\n\nAdditionally, improving physiological function at submaximal work rates may lead to alterations in other important testing outcomes, particularly the ventilatory threshold. The ventilatory threshold is used as a reference point for prescribing exercise intensity. An intervention that modifies this value would have repercussions for physical fitness practitioners who prescribe exercise intensity relative to the ventilatory threshold.\n\nThe general purpose of this study is to determine the effect of virtual reality on maximal aerobic exercise test performance in healthy adults. The specific questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does using a virtual reality program during a maximal aerobic exercise test lead to differences in VO2peak (maximal aerobic capacity)? and,\n* Does using a virtual reality program during a maximal aerobic exercise test lead to differences in work rate at the ventilatory threshold?\n\nSecondary questions this study aims to answer include:\n\nDoes using a virtual reality program during a maximal aerobic exercise test lead to differences in\n\n* exercise test time?\n* maximal heart rate during the exercise test?\n* maximal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the exercise test?\n* heart rate (HR) at the ventilatory threshold?\n* RER at the ventilatory threshold?\n* psychological response \\[rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and affective valence\\] throughout the exercise test?\n\nTo address these aims, participants will complete the same maximal aerobic exercise test on a cycler ergometer under normal laboratory conditions (Control) and when viewing an immersive virtual reality video (VR). The two tests will be completed in a randomized and counterbalanced order to account for learning or familiarity effects, and will be separated by 1 week to account for the effects of testing fatigue.\n\nRespiratory data, HR, RPE, and affective valence were collected during the exercise tests to address the aims of the study."
