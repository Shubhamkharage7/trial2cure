This study will investigate the effects of 4-week rTMS treatment on brain and cognitive functions in patients. Subjects will be randomized to one of the following arms:\n\nArm 1: Standard of Care (SOC) and active rTMS Arm 2: Standard of Care (SOC) and sham rTMS\n\nEach participant will receive rTMS five days per week, for four consecutive weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, clinical assessments, and cognitive tests will be performed at baseline, end of the 2nd week, and end of the 4th week."
