            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in preventing lung cancer patients with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer or high-risk pulmonary nodules. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab eliminates persistent (on two computed tomography \\[CT\\] scans at least 3 months apart with no evidence of shrinkage or regression) high-risk indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) at 6 months after treatment initiation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab decreases the incidence of lung cancers confirmed by histology (biopsy or resection).\n\nII. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab prolongs cancer free survival (disease free survival \\[DFS\\]) compared with observation in patients with high-risk IPNs.\n\nIII. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab prolongs lung cancer-specific survival compared with observation in patients with high-risk IPNs.\n\nIV. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with observation in patients with high-risk IPNs.\n\nV. To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with high-risk IPNs.\n\nVI. To assess quality of life patient reported outcomes in patients treated with pembrolizumab compared with patients under observation.\n\nVII. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab decreases the solid component of high-risk IPNs.\n\nVIII. To assess the health-related quality of life (QoL) on subjects enrolled in the study.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore the radiographic (including radiomic features) evolution of high-risk IPNs with and without treatment of pembrolizumab and to assess their association with risks of risk of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.\n\nII. To explore the germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile and genomic evolution of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of patients with high-risk IPNs and assess their association with risks of risk of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.\n\nIII. To explore the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire evolution of patients with high-risk IPNs and assess their association with risks of risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.\n\nIV. To explore the evolution of serum soluble factors, such as IFN-gamma and interferon inducible factors (such as CXCL9 and CXCL10), IL-12, TNFalpha, IL-10, TGF-beta, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, C-reactive protein etc. and assess their association with risks of risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.\n\nV. To explore the evolution of immunophenotyping or characterization of the immune cell subsets in the periphery, including, but not limited to, T cells, B cells, natural killer \\[NK\\] cells, or subpopulations of the aforementioned immune cell types and assess their association with risks of risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.\n\nVI. To explore the evolution of microbiome and assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeat every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) scans and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter conclusion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months."

Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n   * Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n   * Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n   * Has a known additional metastatic malignancy that is progressing or requiring active treatment. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ), or potentially curable early-stage malignancies including localized NSCLC, head and neck squamous carcinoma, breast cancer, bladder cancer etc., that have undergone potentially curative therapy (surgery and/or radiation with or without chemotherapy) are not excluded.\n   * Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n   * Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n   * Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n   * Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\n   * Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\n   * Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n   * Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n   * Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n   * Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.",
