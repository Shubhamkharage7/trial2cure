            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in treating patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) that have been previously treated with brentuximab vedotin or checkpoint inhibitors. Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in combination may be an effective treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma previously treated with brentuximab vedotin or checkpoint inhibitors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) with brentuximab vedotin (brentuximab)/nivolumab used in combination in patients in patients previously treated with brentuximab in combination with standard chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).\n\nII. To determine the ORR with brentuximab/nivolumab in combination in patients previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy for HL.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the complete response rate (CRR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with brentuximab/nivolumab in patients previously treated with brentuximab in combination with standard chemotherapy for HL.\n\nII. To determine the CRR and PFS with brentuximab/nivolumab in patients previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy for HL.\n\nIII. To evaluate safety of this regimen using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0 (v 5.0).\n\nIV. To determine the tolerability of this regimen using patient-reported outcomes including Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE or pediatric PRO-CTCAE, neuropathy (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity \\[FACT/GOG-NTX\\]), and fatigue quality of life (QOL) by strata.\n\nV. To determine the number of patients who proceed to autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\n\nVI. To determine the number of patients who successfully undergo stem cell collection among those planning to proceed to autologous HSCT.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response or partial response at any time after 4 cycles may discontinue study therapy to proceed to autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years."
