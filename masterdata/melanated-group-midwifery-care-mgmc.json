In pregnancy and into the first year postpartum, MGMC patients will stay connected to the health system through a proactive care coordinator, who is a Black licensed nurse. For the first year after giving birth, patients in MGMC will also be supported by a trained postpartum doula.\n\nAll participants (intervention and usual care groups) will complete study measures that include validated surveys on patient trust, respect and engagement at 6 time points:\n\n* 3 time points in pregnancy \\[baseline (\\<20 weeks), 26-28 weeks, and 35- 37 weeks\\] and\n* 3 in the postpartum at 2-, 6-, and 12-months\n* Additional qualitative interviews will be done to track the care received by medically and socially complex patients, including all who experience a severe maternal morbidity.\n\nThe investigators will also document how MGMC gets embedded in practice through a qualitative process evaluation."
