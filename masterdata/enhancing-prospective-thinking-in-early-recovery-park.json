This clinical trial will test the VR intervention for efficacy in reducing opioid use, increasing abstinence, and other self-reported and behavioral focus on future outcomes in individuals in early recovery from opioid use disorder.\n\n* Will the VR group, compared to the control group, have a lower number of opioid use days?\n* Will the VR group, compared to the control group, have longer periods of abstinence at the 30-day follow-up?\n* Will the VR group, compared to the control group, have significantly increased opioid abstinence rates?\n* Will the VR group, compared to baseline and the control group, show increased future self-identification post-VR intervention?\n* Will the VR group, compared to baseline and the control group, show increased future orientation post-VR intervention?\n* Will the VR group, compared to baseline and the control group, show an increased preference for delayed rewards in a laboratory delay discounting task post-VR intervention?\n* Will the VR group, compared to baseline and the control group, exceed in behavioral effects (i.e., future self-identification, future orientation, and increased preference for delayed rewards) at the 30-day follow-up?\n\nResearchers will compare the VR test group and the control group to see if there are differences in the results for the questions outlined above."
