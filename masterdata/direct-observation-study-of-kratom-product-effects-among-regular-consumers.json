The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What are the acute physiological, subjective, and cognitive effects of kratom following participant self-administration of a single oral dose of the participants usual kratom product at the participants typical dose?\n2. What are the physiological, subjective, and cognitive effects associated with kratom product discontinuation among adults who use regularly?\n3. What are the pharmacokinetics of kratom products consumed by adults who use regularly? On the first study day: Under direct observation, participants will self-administer a single oral dose of the participants own commercial kratom product that that is regularly taken and will consume it at the participants self-selected typical dose/serving. Following this, serial blood draws and urine collection will occur along with administration of validated questionnaires, tests, and continual monitoring. After this first study day, participants will no longer be permitted to use any of the participants kratom product during the study. On study nights/days 2-3: participants will reside a clinical research unit and be observed and evaluated for kratom withdrawal syndrome."
