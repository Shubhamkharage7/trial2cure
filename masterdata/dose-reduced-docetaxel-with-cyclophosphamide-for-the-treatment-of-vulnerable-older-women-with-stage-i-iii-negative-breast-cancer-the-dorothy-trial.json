            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well dose-reduced docetaxel combined with cyclophosphamide works in treating older women with early stage (stage I-III) HER2 negative breast cancer vulnerable to toxicity. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide are commonly used, but is not well tolerated at the standard dose and can affect the way older patients feel physically and emotionally. Giving dose-reduced docetaxel combined with cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment option and improve quality of life in vulnerable older women with stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Compare the relative dose intensity (RDI) of reduced- versus (vs.) standard-dose docetaxel dosing strategies.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Compare treatment tolerability of reduced- vs. standard-dose docetaxel dosing strategies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive dose-reduced docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive standard dose docetaxel IV over 60 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then at least twice yearly for 2 years."
