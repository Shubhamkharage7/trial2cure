            "briefSummary": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is prevalent and debilitating chronic disease in Veterans. COPD is highly co-morbid with depression and anxiety conferring greater morbidity and mortality risk. Physical activity is a modifiable behavior that can improve COPD outcomes. However, to date, interventions targeting physical activity have not addressed the high comorbidity between COPD and depression and/or anxiety symptoms (\"emotional distress\") despite emotional distress predicting poorer response to physical activity interventions. This CDA-2 proposal will develop and test the acceptability and feasibility of an integrative physical activity and mental health intervention for Veterans with COPD, emotional distress, and low physical activity. The intervention will be delivered via VA Video Connect enabling access to care among Veterans with substantial barriers to hospital-based outpatient care.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current study will develop and test Step-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (Step-CBT), an integrated intervention that draws from existing pedometer-based physical activity (PA) interventions and brief CBT to target low PA, emotional distress, and physical disability in Veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) delivered via VA Video Connection (VVC). This study has three components: In Aim 1, we will conduct a cross-sectional study with 50 Veterans with COPD, low PA, and clinically significant depression and/or anxiety symptoms. Self-report measures will be collected and provide information on mean level and magnitude of the relations between PA, emotional distress, and physical disability. Participants will wear an ActiGraphy device for 14 days following their in-person session to measure objective PA. Based on these data, we will create Step-CBT, an intervention that integrates, tailors, and adapts a pedometer-based PA intervention and brief CBT (existing transdiagnostic protocol), based on patient interviews and current literature. In Aim 2, we will examine the acceptability of Step-CBT, an 8-session intervention delivered via VVC, in Veterans (N=6) collecting recruitment, enrollment, completion data and measures of physical functioning and emotional distress. We will conduct expert panel review of the manualized intervention protocol and acceptability results. In Aim 3, we will assess the feasibility of Step-CBT in a proof-of -concept study design in Veterans (N=25) with COPD, low physical activity, and clinically significant depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The current research has great potential to improve physical and psychological functioning in Veterans with COPD through the development of an integrated PA-mental health intervention. Step-CBT delivered to patient's homes, would offer a safe option to increase/maintain physical functioning and mental health in Veterans with COPD."
