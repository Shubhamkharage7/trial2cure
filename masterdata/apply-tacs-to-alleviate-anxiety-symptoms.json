The NM used in this study consists of 25 minutes of 5 hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) titrated up to 2mA targeting the anterolateral amygdala across 12 treatment sessions with a 3-4 week time period. The studied population includes patients with the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), separation anxiety disorder of childhood, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants will be randomly assigned to tACS or sham, cross-over, then followed by an optional open-label extension phase."
