            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I modified 3 + 3 design, in which the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified. The 3 + 3 dose escalation will consist of 6 dose levels (18 participants; planned escalation described in arms below) in combination with variation in dosing schedules of the drug lopinavir/ritonavir. This design also allows for some possible intermediate doses to be examined if dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occur and de-escalation is needed.\n\nAn expansion cohort of 12 participants will occur at the MTD. Once the MTD is determined, then secondary outcomes will be evaluated.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intra-anal administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, administered via suppository with 3 different schedules, in PLWH with high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) (AIN 2/3).\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To measure the effect of intra-anal topical lopinavir/ritonavir administration\n* To evaluate clearance of human papillomavirus (HPV)\n* To elucidate the mechanism of action of protease inhibitors"
