Given the potential role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis, guselkumab may be an effective option to treat the initial manifestation of guttate psoriasis. This is a two-arm open-label study to evaluate the clinical and immunogenetic responses of patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis to treatment with guselkumab. The primary objective of this study is to assess how treatment with guselkumab changes the immune milieu of the skin in patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess how treatment with guselkumab affects the quality of life and extent of skin disease in patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis."
