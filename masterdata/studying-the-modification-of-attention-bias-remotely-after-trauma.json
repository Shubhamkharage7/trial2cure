To assess effects of the training and control conditions, the investigators will administer tests of threat-related attention bias and variability, and self-report assessments of PTSS, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at baseline, after one and two weeks of training, and at eight-week follow up. The investigators plan to screen and confirm interest from over 3,000 eligible participants over a period of 24 months to enroll and randomize 1,897 participants with the end goal of 1,232 completers (176 per condition)."
