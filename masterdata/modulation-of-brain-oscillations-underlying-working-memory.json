            "detailedDescription": "In this study, healthy adult individuals will perform a spatial working memory task as investigators record scalp EEG before and immediately after undergoing transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Each participant will complete four tACS sessions in randomized order: 1) theta-nested gamma tACS applied during active task periods, 2) theta-nested gamma tACS applied during passive (rest) periods, 3) gamma stimulation applied in phase with ongoing theta oscillations, and 4) placebo tACS. The different stimulation protocols will take place on different days. Therefore, participants will be expected to attend 4 in-person study visits at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown, Massachusetts."
