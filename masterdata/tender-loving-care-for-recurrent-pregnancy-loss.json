(2) Does participation in weekly, interactive tender loving care messages increase patients' quality of life? Does participation in weekly, interactive tender loving care messages decrease patients' depressive symptoms?\n\nParticipants will be asked to interact with weekly messages providing prenatal counseling and support. Additionally, patients will be asked to complete the fertility quality of life survey several times over the course of the pregnancy.",
