            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether a program to optimize patient physical fitness and nutrition (\"prehabilitation\") prior to and after plastic surgery involving the abdomen improves surgical outcomes. The investigators hope to determine how a multimodal peri-operative prehabilitation program can be most effective in engaging and motivating patients to physically and mentally get ready for an abdominally-based plastic surgery operation. The overall goal is to determine if this program will improve post-operative recovery after abdominally-based plastic surgery. The importance of this new knowledge is better understanding of ways that plastic surgeons can improve outcomes, engagement, and experience of patients undergoing abdominally-based plastic surgery operations. This would translate to increased healthcare value and better long-term outcomes."
