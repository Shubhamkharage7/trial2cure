The safety of this treatment will be evaluated, and researchers want to learn if NK cells will help in treating acute myeloid leukemia."

(Exception will be granted for monoclonal antibodies that are known to have long half-lives, in which case a minimum of 2 weeks from last dose will be required). For agents that have known AEs occurring beyond these specified days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which acute AEs are known to occur. Treating physicians are encouraged to discuss cases with the Medical Monitor.\n* Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Patient has new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusion large enough to be detected by chest x-ray or CT scan within 2 weeks of first CYNK-001 infusion.\n* Patient has active autoimmune disease other than controlled connective tissue disorder or those who are not on active therapy.\n* Patient has had a Bone Marrow transplant \\< 60 days prior to screening or plans to have a transplant within the 28 day period following the first CYNK-001 infusion.\n* Patient has a history of malignancy other than AML or other underlying hematologic conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) unless the Patient has been free of disease for greater than 3 years prior to CYNK 001 infusion.

Prophylactic antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal medication are permissible.\n* Patient has any other organ dysfunction (CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade 3 or greater) that will interfere with the administration of the therapy according to this protocol.\n* Patient has a resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \\< 40% obtained by echocardiography or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA).\n* Patient was treated with an investigational product within 28 days of first CYNK-001 infusion.
