R21 stage (IRB-61727) was focused on intervention development; R33 stage will focus on pilot testing the effect of the intervention. The R21 phase was not considered a NIH defined clinical trial; R33 will be considered a NIH defined clinical trial)\n\nThe purpose is to develop and test the effect of a \"personalized\" computer-based cognitive training program. The personalized program tailors the difficulty of the training tasks using a participant's biofeedback (i.e., heart rate) and cognitive performance. Such a personalization will ensure that the participant can perform at his/her ideal training capacity. Participants will be randomized into one of 2 groups and each group will play a different version of computerized training game and have ECG collected to allow subject blinding."

Executive function will be measured using the EXAMINER, a computerized test package designed for RCTs. It includes 8 tests and calculates 4 sub-domain composite scores on working memory (Dot counting and N-back), inhibition (Flanker, Continuous Performance Test, and Anti-saccades), cognitive control (Dimensional Set Shifting), and Fluency (Phonemic Fluency and Category Fluency), and an overall composite score for executive function.

In this functional template, CAN related networks will be focused, including SN, DMN, subcortical network, and frontoparietal networks, along with ACC subregions. The data will be analyzed using the FSL software packages. fMRI preprocessing will consist of motion correction, slice-timing correction, normalization, and Gaussian spatial smoothing (FWHM 8mm). To calculate resting-state and task-related fMRI, the correlation coefficient between ROI pair across the time course will be Fisher Z-transformed and averaged to derive summary scores for network strength; higher indicates stronger network strength.",
