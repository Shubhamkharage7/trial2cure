Determine the feasibility of implementing behavioral health counseling sessions alongside standard of care treatment for brain tumor participants scheduled to undergo craniotomy for treatment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the acceptance of virtual behavioral health counseling sessions during the initial management of a newly diagnosed brain tumor.\n\nII. To explore the rates of pre- and post-surgical mental health disorders in participants newly diagnosed with a brain tumor.\n\nIII. To explore pre- and post-surgical quality of life with virtual behavioral health counseling sessions during the initial management of a newly diagnosed brain tumor.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants will be given the opportunity to participate in virtual behavioral health counseling sessions at three time points relative to the scheduled tumor resection operation. All participants will receive questionnaires related to mental health, quality of life, and satisfaction with the study intervention. Participants who do not want to participate in the counseling sessions will be provided the option to complete the assessment tools related to mental health and quality of life only. Participants will be assessed over the course of 9 months related to standard-of-care treatment at the following time points: before the operation (baseline), 4 to 6 weeks following the operation, and 6 to 9 months following the operation. At each time point, the participants will fill out the questionnaires and engage in the virtual counseling sessions."
