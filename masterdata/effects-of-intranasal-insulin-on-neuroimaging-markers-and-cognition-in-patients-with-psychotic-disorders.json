            "detailedDescription": "Psychotic disorders are common and severe psychiatric disorders. Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders, more effective and tolerable treatments are still needed. Evidence suggests that energy metabolism is altered in psychotic disorders. The investigators recently developed non-invasive MRI-based techniques to quantify redox balance and ATP generation in the brain. Targeting insulin pathways in the brain may allow for modulating abnormalities in energy metabolism. The investigators seek to examine whether intranasal insulin can modulate energy metabolism and improve cognition in patients with psychotic disorders. The study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology to measure in vivo energy metabolism processes in the brain, before and after the administration of intranasal insulin. Investigators will also measure changes in cognition with the administration of intranasal insulin."
