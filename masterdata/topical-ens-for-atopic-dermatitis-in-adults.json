Presence of specific bacteria via qPCR. Two affected skin sites will be sampled as part of the screening tests; if at least one of the affected skin sites contains the specified bacteria, the participant is eligible pending eligibility in all the other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

No more than 2 attempts to detect the specified bacterial colonization over 14 days may be made.\n9. Acceptable screening laboratory values that are within normal limits or are not clinically significantly abnormal (Table 7). If clinical significance is unclear, the investigator must consult with Concerto's medical monitor.\n\n   * Complete blood count with WBC differential (including absolute values).\n   * Chemistry panel including hepatic transaminases.\n   * CRP.\n   * Urinalysis.\n   * 12-lead electrocardiogram.\n   * For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), serum and/or urine test consistent with a non-pregnant state.\n10.

Presence of non-AD dermatologic disorder(s) including, but not limited to, the following dermatitides: photodermatitis, allergic contact, infestations (including scabies), eczematous eruption (eg, secondary to calcium channel blockers), nummular, stasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, xerotic, widespread seborrheic, bullous pemphigoid (prodromal phase), eczematous psoriasis, or mycosis fungoides (Sezary syndrome).\n5. Presence of idiopathic chronic eczematous eruption of aging - defined as new-onset, atopic-like dermatitis presenting in people \\> 50 years old with no history of childhood AD.\n6. Presence of indwelling arterial or venous catheters.\n7. Cardiac valve disease history or artificial valve or pacemaker in place.\n8. Implanted devices/prostheses including, but not limited to, eye lens, knee, hip, etc. replacements.\n9.

Active malignancy or history of malignancy in the past 3 years (Exceptions: superficial skin cancers - squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of the skin, curatively treated with cryosurgery or surgical excision only and indolent prostate cancer).\n15. Clinically significant cardiovascular, liver, pulmonary, neurologic, metabolic, or kidney disease or any other comorbid medical, surgical, social, or psychiatric condition, that, in the opinion of the investigator, puts the participant at increased risk, might lead to study noncompliance, and/or confounds interpretation of safety and efficacy data.\n16. Required to take immunosuppressive drugs (eg, including but not limited to chemotherapy, systemic corticosteroids \\[\u2265 10 mg prednisone equivalent/day; allowed corticosteroids: inhaled, intra-articular, topical, or if systemic, permitted at doses intended only for adrenal replacement, or if \u2265 5 days prior to first ENS-002 administration, on a one-time basis as a prophylaxis for imaging procedures\\], anti-tumor necrosis factor, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, dapsone, methotrexate, mycophenylate mofetil, azathioprine, anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) antibody, anti-IL-1 antibody, or anti-CD20 antibody).
