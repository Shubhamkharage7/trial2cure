            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nBronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a complication people can experience after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It usually affects people with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). This occurs when donor stem cells attack the cells of the person who received them. BOS reduces airflow and oxygen levels in the body. It may be caused by neutrophil elastase in the body. Researchers believe the new drug alvelestat (MPH966) may help.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo test the safety of alvelestat (MPH966) and see what dose best inhibits neutrophil elastase in people with BOS after a stem cell transplant. To study how well the best dose improves lung function in those people.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults 18 and older who have had a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and have cGVHD and BOS.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They will have lung function and heart function tests. They will have computed tomography scans of the chest.\n\nStudy part 1: Participants will take the starting dose of the study drug by mouth twice a day for 14 days. This is 1 cycle. They will get different doses, for up to 4 cycles.\n\nStudy part 2: Participants will take the study drug twice a day by mouth at the dose set in part 1, for up to 12 months.\n\nParticipants will keep medicine diaries.\n\nParticipants will have several study visits. These may include:\n\nRepeats of the screening tests.\n\nBronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.\n\nSputum samples taken.\n\n6-minute walking test.\n\ncGVHD assessment and answer questions.\n\nParticipants will be contacted after the study for up to 24 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of non-relapse morbidity and mortality in persons after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT).\n* Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a complication of cGVHD associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and treatment options are limited.\n* Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a protease released by neutrophils in the setting of inflammation, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BOS.\n* Alvelestat (MPH966) (Formerly known as AZD9668) is a potent and selective inhibitor of NE that has demonstrated evidence of target inhibition and a good safety profile in patients with inflammatory lung diseases, but has not been evaluated in BOS.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPhase 1b:\n\nTo determine the optimal biologic dose (OBD) based on maximal NE inhibition measured in blood, and to determine the safety of alvelestat (MPH966) in patients with BOS after SCT\n\nPhase 2:\n\nTo determine the clinical efficacy of alvelestat (MPH966) at the OBD in patients with BOS after SCT, based on the proportion of patients with stable or improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) on pulmonary function testing\n\nEligibility:\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years\n* BOS after SCT and moderate to severe cGVHD as defined by the NIH consensus criteria\n* Within 5 years from the time of diagnosis (Phase 2 only)\n* Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%\n* If on systemic cGVHD therapy, must be receiving stable or tapering doses in the preceding 4 weeks\n* Patients will be required to have received prior treatment with a regimen consisting of inhaled steroids and montelukast plus or minus azithromycin for at least 3 months prior to enrollment, unless there is evidence of progression or unsatisfactory response while on this regimen prior to 3 months of treatment, as deemed by the treating or referring physician.\n* Patients who are on azithromycin, an antibiotic used in the treatment of BOS, will need to discontinue for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* FEV1 \\< 30% (based on absolute percent predicted using USA-ITS-NIH equation) on pulmonary function testing\n* Prior use of neutrophil elastase inhibitors\n* Progressive malignancy\n* Uncontrolled infection or any major organ dysfunction as defined by the protocol\n\nDesign:\n\nPhase 1b:\n\n* This is a Phase 1b trial to determine the OBD and safety of alvelestat (MPH966) in patients with BOS after SCT.\n* This trial will use an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. The starting dose will be 60mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and the dose will be increased by 60mg with each escalation every 2 weeks until a maximum dose of 240mg twice daily is reached for a total treatment period of 8 weeks. After completion of the dose escalation phase, patients will have the option to continue the dose at which maximal NE inhibition and safety are demonstrated for up to 6 additional months.\n* The co-primary endpoint of OBD will be defined as the dose level at which the maximal NE inhibition occurs, and at which no more than 1/3 of patients experience a DLT. NE activity will be measured in the blood at baseline and with each dose escalation, and will be compared between dose levels to determine the OBD.\n* The co-primary endpoint of safety will be determined by monitoring adverse events and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) as defined by the protocol. Further dose escalation will cease in a patient who experiences a DLT. In addition, no subsequent patients will be treated at or beyond the dose in which 1/3 of patients have experienced a DLT.\n* A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in the Phase 1b trial.\n\nPhase 2:\n\n* This is a Phase 2 trial to determine the efficacy of alvelestat (MPH966) at the OBD in patients with BOS after SCT, as measured by stabilization or improvement of FEV1 (based on absolute percent predicted) after 6 months of treatment.\n* Patients will receive alvelestat (MPH966) using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. The starting dose will be 60 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and the dose will be increased by 60 mg twice daily with each dose escalation every 2 weeks until a maximum dose of\n\n  240 mg twice daily is reached for a total treatment period of 18 weeks (total of 6 cycles). There is an optional continuation phase for 24 more weeks (cycles 7-12) with each cycle being 28 days and pulmonary function testing with measurement of FEV1 will be performed to determine the primary endpoint.\n* Response assessments will occur every 3 months with primary efficacy endpoint evaluated at 6 months. Patients with stable or responding disease will have the option to continue therapy for another 6 months.\n* As an early stopping rule for futility, if 0-2 of the first 8 patients enrolled have responded, then no further patients will be accrued. A total of 20 patients may be needed for evaluation in phase II.\n\nIn order to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 34 patients across both phases."
