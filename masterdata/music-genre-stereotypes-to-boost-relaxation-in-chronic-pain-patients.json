Group 2 (Nature): Participants in this group will listen to nature sounds over the 4 weeks.\n3. Music Waitlist Group: Participants in this group will serve as a control and will not receive any intervention until the study is completed. They will complete a baseline survey and a follow-up survey at four weeks. Some recordings will be sent to this group after the study is completed, without tracking their usage.\n\nIntervention\n\nAll groups will complete a baseline and 4-week follow-up survey.\n\nParticipants in Group 1 and Group 2 will engage in daily listening 4-week intervention.They will have access to electronic audio recordings, with the order of listening labeled for each day. It is up to them if they want to listen to the daily recordings."
