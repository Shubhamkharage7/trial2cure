Also, early detection of lung cancer with low dose CT screening may cure patients at an early stage. Circulating and disseminated tumor cell (CTC/DTC) and circulating cell-free (cf) DNA isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow will increase understanding of cancer spread and advance knowledge to develop individualized therapies and improve screening.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background: Patients with resectable solid primary cancers and even limited number of metastases are potentially curable. However, most patients develop recurrences despite surgery. Circulating and disseminated tumor cell (CTC/DTC) and circulating cell-free (cf) DNA isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow will increase understanding of cancer spread and advance knowledge to develop individualized therapies. These liquid biomarkers might also be suitable for screening purposes and early detection of in high risk subjects for lung cancer.\n\nHypothesis and Rationale: CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA isolated from the blood, urine and bone marrow undergo pheno- and/or genotype changes. CTCs/DTCs have potential for dissemination and tumor growth in vivo. Investigating the biology of liquid biomarkers in the blood, urine and bone marrow will significantly increase understanding of cancer biology of early and advanced stages.\n\nSpecific Aims: CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA will be quantified and characterized for genetic alterations and expression of key signaling/proliferation biomarkers and grow in vivo in nude mice.\n\nStudy Design: 100 cancer patients will be recruited for CTC/DTC/cfDNA isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow with innovative techniques. Bone marrow will be drawn only perioperatively in cancer patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery. 200 high-risk individuals undergoing lung cancer screening with a low dose CT will also be included for blood and urine collection to test the usefulness of these liquid biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer. In addition, 20 individuals with benign disease will also be included as controls. CTCs/DTCs, cfDNA and cancer tissue pheno- and/or genotype analysis will be performed with different innovative techniques. Furthermore, CTCs/DTCs will be enriched, cultured and characterized. Tumor growth potential will be studied in nude mice.\n\nRelevance: This study addresses fundamental aspects of cancer disease being the cause of death in 1 out of 4 persons in the US. Innovative CTCs/DTCs characterization can shed light on the tumor biology, and identify therapy targets. Results of this study can be fundamentally important to understanding cancer spread and development of personalized therapies, and improve early detection."
