There are limited pediatric literature evaluating the use of laryngeal mask airway for laparoscopic procedures compared with traditional endotracheal intubation. This study aims to add to this literature in providing information comparing the two techniques. The rationale for this study is to show that general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway is an effective and non-inferior technique compared with general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation in pediatric patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and may offer benefits in terms of efficiency of care and respiratory complications."
