Compare physical activity and cognitive functions between children having cardiac surgery with an age-matched group of children undergoing non-cardiac surgery, as well as otherwise healthy siblings or best buddies (or age and gender-matched children if no siblings or best buddies available) before surgery and after surgery or six months following initial assessment.\n2. Determine the effects of a structured physical activity program for 6 months following surgery on cognitive functions and adaptive behavior in children following congenital cardiac surgery.\n3. Determine the effects of a structured physical activity program for 12 months following surgery on cognitive functions and adaptive behavior in children following congenital cardiac surgery.\n4. We will perform exploratory analysis to determine whether any effects of a 12-months structured physical activity program on cognitive functions and adaptive behavior persist beyond 12 months after cessation of the program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Mortality associated with congenital heart defects (CHD) has decreased significantly world-wide over the past decades. As more CHD patients are surviving beyond infancy and childhood, these patients are found to be at significant risk for developmental disabilities and developmental delay. In CHD patients, their neurodevelopmental impairments, as suggested by recent data from the Boston Circulatory Arrest Trial, appear to become more serious with increasing age. As they mature into adolescents and adults, more areas of neurocognitive abnormalities become evident. These abnormalities significantly influence their ability to function independently in their daily living and impact their quality of life. Physical activity has been shown to improve cognitive function in adults and improve attentional inhibition and cognitive flexibility in school-age children between 7 to 9 years of age. An exercise program has also been shown to improve self-reported cognitive functioning and parent-reported social functioning in older children and adolescents (age 10-25 years) with Tetralogy of Fallot or single ventricle physiology. Of note, neuroimaging studies have further documented that physical activity induces an increase in hippocampal volume which corresponds to the observed improvement in memory tasks. Since neurocognitive functions in CHD patients become worse as they get older, any early intervention that can mitigate the neurocognitive impairment in these patients will modify their negative neurodevelopmental trajectory and thus could have a major impact on the mental and cognitive well-being of CHD patients. The purpose of our study is to test the hypothesis that a regular, structured physical activity program as recommended by the American Heart Association will improve cognitive function and adaptive behavior in children with CHD after cardiac surgery."
