The study will explore the use of an imaging agent called hyperpolarized \\[1-13C\\] pyruvate (HP) with MRI scans. (MRI) is a technique that takes pictures of the body's organs using a magnetic field and radiofrequency waves that cannot be felt. In order to accomplish the goal of the study the patient will have two hyperpolarized MRI scans to assess if scans can be reproduced. The hyperpolarized MRI scans will be compared with the pathological results of the surgery to see if the hyperpolarized MRI provides additional information regarding disease metabolism."

For each patient, the upper limit of normal (ULN) value for a particular assay will be defined by the normal reference values of the laboratory that performed the assay\n* Bilirubin \\> 1.5 x (ULN)\n* AST/ALT \\>2.5 x ULN\n* Albumin \\< 3 g/dl\n* GGT \\> 2.5 x ULN if Alkaline phosphatase \\> 2.5 x ULN.\n* Renal: Creatinine \\>1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance \\< 60 mL/min, from assays obtained within 3-4 weeks prior to study enrollment\n* Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)\n* Standard MRI exclusion criteria will also be applied, including pacemakers and metal clips located in the patient.",
