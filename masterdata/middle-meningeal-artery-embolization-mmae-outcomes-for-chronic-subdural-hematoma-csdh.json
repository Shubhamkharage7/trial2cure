            "detailedDescription": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a prevalent neurosurgical condition marked by the accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space. Primarily affecting elderly individuals, cSDH is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Current standard treatments for cSDH involve surgical evacuation through burr hole craniotomy or twist-drill craniotomy; however, recent research has illuminated the potential significance of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) in cSDH pathogenesis, suggesting an innovative minimally invasive treatment avenue. The investigator team is attempting to determine whether MMA embolization has demonstrated a favorable safety profile with a low incidence of treatment-related complications."
