            "briefSummary": "This research study is studying the effects of adding a certain type of immunotherapy to standard bladder-directed radiation as a treatment for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.\n\nThe drug in this study is: Avelumab (also known as BAVENCIO\u00ae)",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the use of avelumab and bladder-directed radiation together for this specific disease but avelumab has been approved for other uses.\n\nWhile bladder-directed radiation is a standard treatment option for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, the use of avelumab in combination with bladder radiation in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is investigational. Radiation is used in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and avelumab has been approved by the FDA in patients with more advanced stages of this disease. Avelumab is a form of immunotherapy, which means it is designed to help the immune system fight cancer cells together with standard cancer treatments like radiation. Avelumab is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic Merckel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test whether the combination of immunotherapy and bladder directed radiation is effective in treating muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The study will also measure other outcomes such as participant's overall health and quality of life during and after treatment. In addition, the investigators will determine if certain biomarkers are correlated with outcomes following treatment with immunotherapy and radiation."

To be considered positive, a lymph node must measure \\>15 mm in short axis.\n* Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease: symptomatic congestive heart failure (\u2265 New York Heart Association Classification Class II), unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or CVA/stroke/MI (\\< 6 months prior to enrollment)\n* Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade \u2265 3)\n* Breast feeding women who are unwilling to stop breastfeeding during treatment and for at least one month after the duration of treatment\n* Patients with known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n* Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immuno-stimulatory agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.\n* Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy\n* Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trial is prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines\n* Major surgery within the last 30 days (with the exception of TURBT).\n* Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive)\n* Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation\n* Patient is unwilling to stop (or wishes to start) taking herbal and natural remedies that may have immune-modulating effects during the study period\n* Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade \\> 1); however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade \u2264 2, or other Grade \u2264 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study.",
