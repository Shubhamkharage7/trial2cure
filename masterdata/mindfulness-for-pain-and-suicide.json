The investigators plan to test the new manual's feasibility and acceptability in a sample of veterans experiencing chronic pain and suicidal ideation. Participants will be randomized to either the MBCT-S/P condition (n=38) or the Education control condition (n=38) to assess additional aspects of study feasibility. The investigators also plan to assess a variety of clinical outcomes including suicidal ideation, pain interference in activities, and opioid use. Participants will complete questionnaires pre-treatment, and 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-treatment."
