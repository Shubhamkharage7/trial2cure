            "briefSummary": "This study will validate the diagnostic accuracy of a cutaneous hydration sensor. This sensor will also be evaluated for its feasibility as a point-of-care device for the assessment of hydration status and its potential to guide hydration therapy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).",
            "detailedDescription": "Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) are the leading cause of hospitalization for patients with SCD. Intravenous fluid replacement is one of the cornerstones of management of VOE in the emergency department and throughout hospitalization. However, there are no evidence-based guidelines specifying the optimal administration of maintenance fluids. Overly aggressive hydration therapy imparts the risk of hypervolemia and pulmonary edema, which may lead to acute chest syndrome and death. Thus, a reliable biomarker is needed to gauge hydration status and guide fluid replacement strategies with the goal of achieving euvolemia.\n\nThe investigators propose a point-of-care test that may inform management (e.g., bolus vs. continuous infusion of maintenance intravenous fluid), and prevent over- or under-hydration. For this purpose, investigators seek to validate the diagnostic accuracy of a cutaneous hydration sensor, Delfin MoistureMeterEpiD (a non-significant risk device) and evaluate its feasibility as a point-of-care device for the assessment of hydration status and potentially guide hydration therapy in patients with SCD. Investigators will measure skin hydration in the clinic when participants are at baseline state of health. Skin hydration before and after fluid resuscitation therapy in patients with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or VOE will also be assessed. Blood and urine will be collected to compare assessments of skin hydration with laboratory biomarkers of hypertonicity and red blood cell dehydration."
