Parents were randomized to the intervention or wait-list control group. Intervention content was delivered in virtual sessions with a parent and interventionist. The primary aim was to examine intervention feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, acceptability) with a secondary goal of preliminary efficacy on intervention changes in child sleep patterns to inform a future large-scale RCT. Exploratory evidence was collected on changes in children's health behaviors (e.g., diet, screen time), and social-emotional health (e.g., behavior problems) as indicators for potential spillover effects on these domains."
