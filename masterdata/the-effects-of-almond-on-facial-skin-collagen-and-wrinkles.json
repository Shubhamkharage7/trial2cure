            "briefSummary": "Investigate the effects of almond consumption on collagen production, elastin levels, wrinkles, and pigmentation among premenopausal women and postmenopausal women belonging to all Fitzpatrick skin types.",
            "detailedDescription": "Almonds are energy-dense and rich in beneficial nutrients including B vitamins, vitamin E, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, protein, fiber, minerals and polyphenols. Polyphenols and vitamin E in almonds provide protection to the body in part, through their ability to combat oxidative stress. Clinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of almond consumption on diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nAlmond consumption has been shown to significantly decrease wrinkle severity in two clinical studies conducted with postmenopausal women with Fitzpatrick skin type I and II. Almond intake has also been shown to increase resistance to erythema induced by ultraviolet exposure. The extracellular matrix contains proteins including collagen and elastin, which contributes to the integrity of the skin. Enzymatic and ultraviolet radiation induced degradation and a reduction in synthesis of collagen and elastin contribute to wrinkle formation. Furthermore, the process of menopause decreases the level of estrogen which affects the skin in several ways, including a decrease in skin collagen and hydration, and an increase in wrinkling."
