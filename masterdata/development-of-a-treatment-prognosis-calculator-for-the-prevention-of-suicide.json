Members of their mental healthcare treatment team may receive intensive training in BCBT. After their provider has received this training, they may use this treatment as part of standard of care treatment. The timing of this training will be determined randomly. Participants will complete self-report assessments at the beginning of the study (baseline) as well as 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after their participant begins. These assessments will include questions about feelings, thoughts, moods, impulses, substance use, and behavior."

In phase 1 (5 sessions), the therapist conducts a detailed assessment of the patient's most recent suicidal episode or suicide attempt, identifies patient-specific factors that contribute to and maintain suicidal behaviors, provides a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization, collaboratively develops a crisis response plan, and teaches basic emotion regulation skills. In phase 2 (5 sessions), the therapist teaches cognitive restructuring skills to build cognitive flexibility. In phase 3 (2 sessions), a relapse prevention task is conducted, and participants must demonstrate the ability to successfully complete this task in order to terminate the treatment. Additional sessions are conducted until participants demonstrate the ability to successfully complete this task.",
