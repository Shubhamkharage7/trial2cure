If a parent is eligible for the larger study and chooses to participate, if so, the participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the I-PCIT intervention now or to be on a waitlist and begin I-PCIT in 5-6 months. The whole study consists of completing I-PCIT sessions with a clinician and completing 3-4 follow-up surveys after the initial screener survey.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study is being done to learn whether a telehealth intervention called \"Internet-Based Parent Child Interaction Therapy,\" or I-PCIT,\" can help parents improve the child's behavior if the child currently or previously went through cancer treatment.\n\nParents who choose to be in this study will complete a survey to help researchers figure out if the parent is eligible for the larger study. If a parent is eligible for the larger study and chooses to participate, the investigators will randomly assign the participants to either receive the I-PCIT intervention now or to be on a waitlist and begin I-PCIT in 5-6 months. The whole study consists of completing I-PCIT sessions with a clinician and completing 3-4 follow-up surveys after the initial screener survey.\n\nI-PCIT is language-dependent. The investigators will make every effort to recruit a Spanish-speaking fellow clinician for this study. However, if unable to recruit a Spanish-speaking fellow, a licensed clinical social worker and certified Spanish interpreter, will provide I-PCIT services to Spanish-speaking families. Children may participate even if the child cannot produce spoken language. Participants may request that research personnel read all assessment materials aloud in a structured interview format, in which case participants could provide verbal item responses. Because of this option, participants' ability to read and write are not requirements for participation.\n\nThe I-PCIT intervention will consist of 13 weekly telehealth sessions with a clinician who is certified in PCIT. The first telehealth session will take about 60-75 minutes. The rest of the telehealth sessions will take about 40-60 minutes. I-PCIT teaches parents how to build more positive interactions with the child and how to improve management of the child's behavior challenges.\n\nParents who receive I-PCIT in this study will not be charged for any I-PCIT services. Parents who are assigned to the waitlist until I-PCIT begins and may continue receiving any other services to help manage the child's behavior while waiting to start I-PCIT.\n\nThe study will last about 5-5 \u00bd months for parents who are assigned to start I-PCIT right away. For parents who are assigned to the waitlist to start I-PCIT in 5-6 months, parents will complete the study, including I-PCIT sessions, in about 8-9 months.\n\nIn addition to the initial survey to see if parents are eligible for I-PCIT, parents who are assigned to I-PCIT or the waitlist will also be asked to complete follow-up surveys 3-4 times during the study."

If a patient's cancer relapses during the study period, the patient's oncologist must agree to the patient continuing in this intervention.\n* The parent must have access to reliable internet service (e.g., in their own home, in a friend or family member's home, via cell phone carrier) and their own smartphone, tablet, or computer to participate in telehealth intervention sessions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Parents will be excluded if they or their child have cognitive, motor, or language delays that would preclude participation, as observed by research staff or listed in the child's medical record. Hearing impaired parents will also be excluded because I-PCIT requires the coach to verbally coach parents via bug-in-ear.\n* Parents will be excluded if their child is expected to undergo bone marrow transplant (BMT) during the study or has received BMT within 2 months of study enrollment.\n* The child must not be receiving end of life care, as determined by medical chart review and/or consultation with the patient's medical team.",
