The goal of the registry is to enable more efficient research recruitment and data collection as well as timely notification to enrollees about newly FDA-approved treatments for AD.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the Registry for Systemic Eczema Therapies (RESET) registry is to serve as a database and biospecimen repository of patients with pediatric-onset atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema. This registry seeks to enroll patients with AD who have used or will initiate any systemic treatment(s) for AD. Such a registry will allow investigators to identify patients who are potentially eligible for AD research protocols, including observational studies or clinical trials. The registry will also prospectively collect data that would then serve as a resource for studying a variety of questions surrounding systemic therapy use in patients with AD, for example comparing the effectiveness of treatments or examining treatment effects on patient-reported outcomes. Moreover, the registry would permit safety monitoring of systemic AD medications, as it would include both patients receiving traditional systemic agents with well-known side effect profiles and patients receiving more novel systemic agents with under-characterized side effect profiles. Finally, this registry would allow for the identification of patients with moderate-to-severe AD who may be eligible to receive and benefit from the rapidly expanding number of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved systemic therapies for AD."
