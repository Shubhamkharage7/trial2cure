            "briefSummary": "The goal of this mixed methods study aims to develop and pilot test an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention for toddlers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and their families. The main question it aims to answer is: Will this AAC intervention improve caregivers' use of naturalistic AAC intervention strategies, leading to increases in children's communication? The investigators will employ qualitative methods to conduct interviews to determine caregiver and speech-language pathologist preferences regarding an AAC intervention. Findings from these interviews will inform the adaptation of the AAC intervention procedures, service delivery approach, and strategies to increase caregiver's treatment adherence. Next, the researchers will conduct six multiple baseline designs across behaviors (AAC strategies) to develop the AAC intervention and demonstrate preliminary efficacy when delivered to families in-person. Caregiver-child dyads will receive 24 in-person intervention sessions during which the therapist will provide AAC instruction and coaching on using AAC strategies to caregivers. Last, the investigators will pilot test the AAC intervention using a hybrid telehealth model with nine caregiver-child dyads. Caregiver-child dyads will receive 24 intervention sessions, eight sessions provided to families in-person, and 16 sessions provided to families via telehealth.\n\nOur long-term goal is to develop a socially valid and effective intervention to improve language outcomes for toddlers with IDD. The researchers propose developing and pilot testing a hybrid telehealth AAC intervention for toddlers with IDD and their families. Researchers employ an implementation science approach, using systematic qualitative methods to identify caregivers' preferences and single-case experimental design methods to assess the feasibility of the AAC intervention. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will improve caregivers' use of naturalistic AAC intervention strategies, leading to increases in children's communication.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1: Determine stakeholders' preferences and needs for two key AAC intervention components: (a) service delivery and (b) strategies to enhance treatment adherence. Researchers will conduct and analyze interviews with ten caregivers and ten speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess the acceptability of different service delivery models (e.g., in person, telehealth, hybrid). Interviews will also focus on identifying strategies (e.g., text-message reminders, video modeling) with the potential to support caregivers' adherence and promote generalization to new activities. Results will inform AAC intervention development (Aim 2).\n\nAim 2: Develop an AAC intervention through iterative testing cycles. Researchers will conduct six multiple-baseline designs to investigate the effects of an AAC intervention on caregivers' AAC intervention strategy use (primary outcome) and children's communication acts (secondary outcome). Six caregiver-child dyads will receive 24 in-person intervention sessions, during which the therapist will teach caregivers to use AAC and language facilitation strategies during family-selected routines. Social validity will be assessed via weekly questionnaires and a post-intervention interview. In this experiment, the feasibility of in-person delivery is investigated to establish the acceptability and effects of the intervention procedures before pilot testing hybrid delivery. Results will inform modifications which will be tested in a hybrid delivery model (Aim 3).\n\nAim 3: Conduct a pilot test of a hybrid telehealth AAC intervention. Researchers will employ a combination multiple probe design to investigate the feasibility of a hybrid telehealth AAC intervention. Nine caregiver-child dyads will receive 24 intervention sessions (8 in-person, 16 telehealth) which include coaching on AAC and language facilitation strategies. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will increase caregivers' AAC intervention strategy use (primary outcome) and children's communication acts (secondary outcome). Child communication outcomes and caregivers' social validity assessments will be explored to inform a future large-scale trial."

Caregivers practice using the AAC intervention strategies during three, five-minute routines with their children. Therapists coach the caregiver on using the targeted strategies during these routines, encouraging caregivers to reflect on their implementation, and developing a plan to use the AAC strategies during activities not practiced during the intervention session.
