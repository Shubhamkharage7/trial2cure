            "detailedDescription": "This is a pragmatic, non-randomized mixed-methods evaluation study designed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the mychoiceTM tool to new Medical Oncology patients as well as to more deeply explore its value to patient in their discussion with their provider about clinical trials as a treatment option over the course of their oncology treatment (Effectiveness).\n\nOur goal is to focus this study with patients who have had their first Medical Oncology Appointment based on a nightly EMR feed. The mychoiceTM link (currently mychoice.kevindurr.com, but will change to mychoice.templehealth.org prior to study launch) will be sent to patients through a REDCap feed where they can review the mychoice tool and voluntarily answer a short 5 question quality improvement (QI) survey about their experience with mychoiceTM. The survey will include a question about their willingness to be contacted regarding the more in-depth effectiveness study. This survey data will only be evaluated at an aggregate level and used for process improvement purposes.\n\nThe effectiveness study will be conducted with patients who have used mychoiceTM and have agreed to be contacted by Fox Chase Research Staff as indicated in their response to one of the questions in the QI survey. Our goal is to conduct follow-up with those patients who used mychoiceTM to evaluate the impact of the tool on patients' perceived preparedness to discuss clinical trials with their physician and insights into this decision-making process over six-months during their treatment. In addition, we will assess provider and system barriers and facilitators to implementation of mychoice in real world settings to guide future dissemination and implementation.\n\nThere are three levels of evaluation questions in this project and specific aims related to each.\n\n1. Can an evidence-based digital health tool designed to promote discussion about clinical trial participation (mychoiceTM) be easily provided to patients in real time, and will this dissemination approach be acceptable to patients and providers? (Aim 1)\n2. For a sub-set of these patients who use the tool and express interest in participating in a follow-up study evaluation, does the tool positively impact their preparation for a discussion about clinical trials participation across their cancer treatment trajectory? (Aim 3. What are the factors (based on Implementation Research frameworks - RE-AIM and Consolidated Framework Implementation Research) that influence the implementation of mychoiceTM in a real world setting that can guide future dissemination and implementation.\n\nTherefore, the aims of this pragmatic, non-randomized, mixed-methods study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability (Aim 1) and effectiveness of the mychoiceTM preparatory tool for patients (Aim 2)."
