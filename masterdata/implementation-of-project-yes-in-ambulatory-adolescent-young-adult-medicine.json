Youth ages 13-25 who screen positive for depression or anxiety as a part of routine care will be offered one of three digital SSIs. Participants will complete questionnaires before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 3-months after completing the intervention so that the study team can investigate if Project YES leads to reductions in depression, anxiety and eating disorder symptoms."
