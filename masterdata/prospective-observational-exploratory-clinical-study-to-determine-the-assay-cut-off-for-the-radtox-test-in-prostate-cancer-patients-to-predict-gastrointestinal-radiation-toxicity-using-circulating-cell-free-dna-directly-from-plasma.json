            "briefSummary": "This clinical study is conducted to develop a new test to identify prostate cancer patients at highest risk of radiotherapy-related complications, especially related to gastrolintestinal (GI) toxicities. This clinical study would allow monitoring of total tissue damage in blood samples as early as after the 2nd but before the 4th radiotherapy dose during week 1 of radiotherapy, which could help clinicians make treatment decisions. Detection of excessive tissue damage at this early time, well before symptoms occur, could allow doctors to tailor interventions which could include patient therapies that would reduce or prevent the problems that occur due to radiotherapy of their cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Currently, a patient's risk for toxicity is based almost exclusively on population statistics. Radiation (and chemotherapy) doses are based on phase I data and not on the individual's specific genetics or hidden predispositions. RadTox measures cell damage as early as after the 2nd but before the 4th radiotherapy dose during week 1 of radiotherapy and should help identify patients at high risk for radiation complications. This should allow physicians to adjust radiation field size and dose to minimize long-term toxicity, especially gastrointestinal toxicities."
