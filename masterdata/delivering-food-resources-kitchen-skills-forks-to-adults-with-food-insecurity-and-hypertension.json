            "detailedDescription": "This behavioral randomized controlled trial will evaluate nutritious food delivery and cooking classes (FoRKS) versus enhanced usual care (EUC) in adults with food insecurity and systolic blood pressure of \u2265120 mm Hg. This project seeks to evaluate the potential for hands-on training in food management skills to create lasting improvements in food security, self-efficacy, nutrition, and risk factor reduction in persons with prevalent chronic disease.\n\nAdults who give informed consent will complete a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measure to confirm blood pressure eligibility. Participants who meet criteria will complete a full baseline assessment, consisting of questionnaires, blood draw, and weight before randomization to one of two arms:\n\n1. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC), consisting of access to existing usual primary care services such as social determinants of health screenings, referrals to food pantries, and assistance enrolling in food assistance programs. They will be enrolled in a 5-week Hypertension Self-Management Education and Support (SMES) class, which is an existing CDC-endorsed program offered at Eskenazi to provide information and skills for managing hypertension (HTN).\n2. Food Resources \\& Kitchen Skills (FoRKS), consisting of the same services as EUC plus home-delivered Mediterranean-style ingredient kits and virtual cooking classes for an additional 11 weeks with embedded lessons in kitchen organization, tool use, nutrition, budgeting, and shopping.\n\nAssessments will be completed around Week 16 as the primary endpoint, and around Week 24 for maintenance evaluation."
