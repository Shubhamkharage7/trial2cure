Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either once daily placebo or once daily rosuvastatin.\n\nPatients meeting all eligibility criteria will be assigned to a randomization arm prior to initiation of a 4-week lead-in phase of the study. All participants will undergo a 4-week, open-label active run-in phase to evaluate initial safety and adherence to rosuvastatin. During this active run-phase, all participants will receive target dose rosuvastatin-- 20 mg daily (10 mg daily for participants of East-Asian ancestry). After the active run-in phase, all participants will continue with their pre-assigned randomization (1:1) treatment of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily (10 mg daily for participants of East-Asian ancestry) or matching placebo.\n\nThe total duration of the study will be 96 weeks in the assigned treatment arm plus the 4-week lead-in period. The primary outcome will be the mean change in liver stiffness from the baseline measurement to the end of study liver stiffness, as measured by ultrasound-based vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE).\n\nThere are 10 participating clinical centers, and we anticipate a total of 256 patients will be recruited for the initial lead-in as we estimate 20% of participants may dropout after the lead-in (256 x 0.8 = 204 for randomization into the study drug treatment phase)."
