The determine acceptability of the intervention with transgender women of color.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a two-arm randomized waitlist controlled trial in which transgender women of color will be randomly allocated to either the enhanced microeconomic intervention that builds on the Trans Sistas of Color Project's existing microeconomic interventions, which includes: (1) $250 in emergency assistance; and (2) peer support to obtain legal gender affirmation (i.e., legal name and gender markers on identification documents). The existing intervention will be enhanced to include (1) 12 weekly educational group sessions on economic empowerment (i.e., job acquisition, income generation through micro-business, and financial literacy) and HIV prevention and care; (2) employment-focused mentoring; and (3) an unconditional grant ($1,200) for use towards acquiring self-led or formal employment. Each condition will complete a baseline survey prior to randomization, a follow-up survey immediately following intervention completion, and 3-month survey after intervention completion. Participants will also complete qualitative exit interviews within one month of completion of intervention completion for both conditions."
