The only exception is corticosteroids used for the treatment of adrenal insufficiency are allowed.\n* Plan to receive a live (attenuated) vaccine during the treatment period and up to 6 weeks after the last dose of investigational product in the long term extension study.\n\nPrior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:\n\n* Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study. Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are excluded.\n\nOther Exclusions:\n\n* Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during study and for an additional 6 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential unwilling to use protocol specified method of contraception see Appendix 5 (Section 11.5) during treatment and for an additional 6 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.\n* Participant has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during dosing with the exception of participants who exhibited sensitivity in parent Study 20170104 but did not result in treatment discontinuation.\n* Participant likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures (e.g., Clinical Outcome Assessments) to the best of the participant and investigator's knowledge.\n* Participant has a history or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder (including laboratory abnormalities), condition, or disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted would pose a risk to participant safety, or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion.",

Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
