The device technology is based on the application of deep brain TMS by means of repetitive pulse trains at a determined frequency. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new investigational stimulation protocol delivered with the BrainsWay Deep TMS device, for the treatment of MDD, demonstrating that it is non-inferior to the current standard-of-care stimulation protocol, in a randomized, controlled study."
