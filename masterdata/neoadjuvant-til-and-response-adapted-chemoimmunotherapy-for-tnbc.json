            "detailedDescription": "Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) with enrichment of immune system cells in and around the tumor are more sensitive to chemoimmunotherapy and have better prognosis. Imaging is often used during the course of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy to monitor how the disease is responding to treatment, and disappearance of a patient's tumor on imaging after chemoimmunotherapy usually means that the tumor will have completely disappeared when the patient goes for surgery. This study will test whether the presence of immune system cells in and around the tumor and the response of the tumor on MRI can be used to personalize the type and amount of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for patients with TNBC."
