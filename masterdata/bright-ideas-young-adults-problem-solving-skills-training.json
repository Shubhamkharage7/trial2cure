            "detailedDescription": "Bright IDEAS-YA is a personalized approach to increase problem-solving ability by fostering positive appraisal of problems as solvable challenges that can be overcome and enhancing rational problem-solving skills to systematically work through any problem. Bright IDEAS-YA intervention consists of six 45-minute one-on-one sessions with a trainer who teaches the participant the Bright IDEAS stepwise approach to problem-solving and guides the participant through solving their own problems using the Bright IDEAS approach.\n\nUp to 344 young adult patients newly diagnosed with cancer will be recruited to participate in this multi-site randomized controlled trial, where the Bright IDEAS-YA intervention will be compared with enhanced usual psychosocial care. Efficacy will be evaluated by examining changes in psychosocial outcomes from baseline to post-intervention (3 months) and follow-up (6, 12 and 24 months). The extent to which changes in aspects of problem-solving ability mediate the intervention effects will be examined."
