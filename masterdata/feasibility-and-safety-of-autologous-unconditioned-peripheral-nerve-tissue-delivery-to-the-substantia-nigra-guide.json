            "briefSummary": "This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm trial design to actively follow participants for 12 months. Ten participants will be enrolled to receive bilateral delivery of Peripheral Nerve Tissue (PNT) to the Substantia Nigra at the time of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery. After 12 months, participants will be followed long term through annual visits for the rest of their lives. Participants will serve as their own donor for the tissue.",
            "detailedDescription": "We recently designed open-label safety studies to investigate the use of an autologous source of cellular tissue from the peripheral nervous system (van Horne et al., 2017, 2018; Quintero et al. 2022), reparative peripheral (sural) nerve tissue containing a variety of cells and neuroprotective factors (Chau et al. 2022). While our previous studies have used injury-activated peripheral nerve tissue (PNT), where the sural nerve is transected and allowed to regenerate in situ for up to about 2 weeks before implantation, here we propose to use na\u00efve, previously uninjured, nerve tissue delivered bilaterally to the substantia nigra at the time participants are undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Participants will be assessed preoperatively, then undergo DBS surgery and delivery of autologous PNT, and then assessed postoperatively at two weeks after surgery, 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter for adverse events and clinical outcomes."
