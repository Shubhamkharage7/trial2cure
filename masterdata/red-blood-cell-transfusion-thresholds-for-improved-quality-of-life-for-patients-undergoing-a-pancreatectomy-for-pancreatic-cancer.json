            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the the feasibility of testing a red blood cell transfusion threshold for improved quality of life for patients undergoing a pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatectomy can be associated with significant blood loss. Blood loss can result in clinically important anemia causing fatigue. Pancreatic cancer itself can be associated with malnutrition and fatigue. Having a red blood cell transfusion threshold that results in a more liberal use of transfusions may improve quality of life for patients undergoing a pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. The primary objective for this pilot study is protocol adherence for the transfusion study we propose for pancreatectomy patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of collecting and processing of all data that will be collected in the full study.\n\nII. Specific emphasis will be given to findings from Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 to determine its sensitivity to changes in health related quality of life (HRQOL) that occur in the perioperative period after pancreatectomy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo red blood cell transfusion if hemoglobin (Hgb) is less than 7 g/dL while on study.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo red blood cell transfusion if Hgb is less than 9 g/dL while on study.\n\nPatients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan, x ray imaging, and blood sample collection throughout the study."
