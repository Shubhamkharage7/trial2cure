A type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design allows us to engage multilevel stakeholders throughout this process, evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced MSS, and identify critical factors for wide-scale implementation. Aim 1 will focus on enhancing the previous version of MSS by collaborating with multi-level stakeholders in qualitative interviews and usability testing. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of enhanced MSS on thorough skin-self examinations (SSE) in a randomized-control trial (RCT) and examine its impact on the diagnosis of new/recurrent melanomas. Aim 3 will focus on assessing selected implementation outcomes and identify factors relevant to future scale-up for widespread dissemination and implementation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a type one hybrid effectiveness-implementation study consisting of three aims. Aim one (Months 1-15) focuses on MSS enhancement using stakeholder collaboration. Aim two (Months 16-60) involves the longitudinal randomized control trial (RCT) comparing behavioral outcomes and effectiveness of enhanced MSS versus an educational webpage. Aim three (Months 16-60) will assess implementation outcomes and identify contextual factors to facilitate scale-up for future dissemination and implementation."
