This is called a \"pilot\" study because the app is still in development. The goal of this research is to see if mothers use the app more when they receive text \"nudges\" to look at it compared to not getting those \"nudges\". The research project is being conducted by Lydia Furman MD.\n\nThe purpose of the app (which is currently in clickable \"wireframe\" status, a \"pre\" app phase) is to support and promote breastfeeding specifically for mothers and fathers/partners who are African American or Black. Other breastfeeding apps have pictures mainly of White or Asian mothers and information that is not oriented toward African American mothers. This app aims to provide accurate and needed breastfeeding information that is culturally attuned.\n\nUp to 24 participants will be enrolled at UHCMC, including up to 20 mothers. Other participants will include up to 4 African American or Black fathers/partners whose partners are interested in breastfeeding."
