            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine called vepdegestrant. The safety and effects of vepdegestrant will be see when given with other medicines. Vepdegestrant is studied to see if it can be a possible treatment for advanced metastatic breast cancer. This type of cancer would have spread from where it started (breast) to other parts of the body and would be tough to treat.\n\nThe study is seeking for participants who have breast cancer that:\n\n* is hard to treat (advanced) and may have spread to other organs (metastatic). is sensitive to hormonal therapy (it is called estrogen receptor positive).\n* is no longer responding to treatments taken before starting this study.\n\nThis study is divided into separate sub-studies.\n\nFor Sub-Study C:\n\nAll the participants will receive vepdegestrant and a medicine called samuraciclib.\n\nVepdegestrant and samuraciclib will be taken once in a day by mouth. The medicines will be taken at home. The experience of people receiving the study medicines will be studied. This will help see if the study medicine is safe and effective.\n\nParticipant will continue to take vepdegestrant and samuraciclib until:\n\n* their cancer is no longer responding, or\n* side effects become too severe.\n\nThey will have visits at the study clinic about every 4 weeks.",

The sub-study is part of Umbrella platform, TACTIVE-U, comprising multiple sub-studies that independently evaluate ARV-471 in participants with Estrogen Receptor Positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (ER+/HER2-) Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer. ARV-471 will act as the backbone therapy given in combination with other anticancer agents thought to have clinical relevance in ER+ breast cancer."
