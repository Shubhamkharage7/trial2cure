Prior to randomization, persons responding to our ads will participate in the following: (1) telephone screening with the study research assistant (RA) to establish eligibility; (2) an orientation session to obtain more information about the study; and, after providing informed consent (3) baseline assessment and screening (bodyweight, maximal fitness test, dietary intake, and questionnaires to assess potential covariates). Prior to randomization, the RA will give participants an accelerometer to assess baseline physical activity (PA) behavior over a one-week period. Participants will then be randomized to one of the two study conditions. Following randomization, all participants will receive our theory-based PA promotion intervention to help them overcome barriers to regular PA. All participants will be given chest strap heart rate (HR) monitors and instructions on wrist palpation. Follow-up assessments will consist of accelerometry for one-week periods at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) throughout the 12 months and bodyweight at 3-month intervals."
