            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy of Calcipotriol ointment combined with 5-fluorouracil cream as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis in Organ Transplant Recipients (OTRs) before transplantation and determine whether it can prevent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in OTRs post-transplant.",
            "detailedDescription": "The main goal of this investigator-initiated clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of topical calcipotriol combined with 5-flourouracil (5-FU) treatment in organ transplant candidates with precancerous skin lesions called actinic keratoses (AKs) with a history of skin cancer in order to prevent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development after transplantation. SCC is the most common cutaneous malignancy seen after transplantation, with a 65-250 fold greater incidence in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) compared to the general population. This increased risk is due to the systemic immunosuppression caused by anti-rejection medications, which are indispensable for protecting against allograft loss. Previously, we have demonstrated the high efficacy of topical calcipotriol plus 5-FU immunotherapy for AKs on the face and scalp in significantly reducing the risk of SCC development within 3 years post-treatment in immunocompetent patients. This SCC risk reduction is accompanied by the induction of robust T cell immunity and TRM cell formation against AKs. Calcipotriol is a low calcemic vitamin D analogue that is FDA-approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Topical 5-FU is a chemotherapy that is the standard treatment for AKs. Our previous research demonstrates the synergistic impact of calcipotriol in combination with 5-FU on a robust T cell immunity against early skin carcinogenesis in immunocompetent patients. Therefore, we aim to determine the efficacy of this immunotherapy before transplantation in reducing the risk of SCC post-transplant despite the immunosuppressive medications."
