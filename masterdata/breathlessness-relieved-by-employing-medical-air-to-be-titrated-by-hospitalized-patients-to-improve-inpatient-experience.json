The PneumoCool device is a disposable, bladeless, highly portable device that uses medical-grade air that confers many advantages in a hospital setting.",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be randomized control trial (RCT) for patients admitted to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, ROSS and James Cancer Hospital. Patients will be screened to assess eligibility. The study team will use a 2-group (intervention vs. control) RCT design. On meeting inclusion criteria, completed informed consent will be obtained. After informed consent, subjects will be randomized to receive either the PneumoCool device or usual therapy. PneumoCool setup will be done by the study team. This study will be unblinded, since blinding is not feasible in this device study. Conventional therapy will include the patients usual care and any palliation for patients' symptoms ordered by the primary team, including bedside fan if the patient requests. Patients will be queried for their symptoms at the time of enrollment, at time 0 (start of first arm of trial) and 8 hours for the primary outcome. Patient will be followed throughout their hospital stay until discharge. Data will be collected from the electronic medical record. Patient and Provider satisfaction will be noted."
