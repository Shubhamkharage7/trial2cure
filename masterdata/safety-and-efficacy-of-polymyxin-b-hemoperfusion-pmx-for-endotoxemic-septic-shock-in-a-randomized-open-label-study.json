Subjects in critical care areas will be assessed for septic shock using known or suspected infection, multiple organ failure, fluid resuscitation and hypotension requiring vasopressor support as primary criteria. Subjects will meet all entry criteria for study if endotoxin activity is within the range of \u2265 0.60 to \\<0.90.\n\nEligible and consented subjects will be randomized to receive either the PMX cartridge (administered twice for 1\u00bd to 2 hours per treatment session approximately 24 hours apart) plus standard medical care or standard medical care alone. For all randomized subjects, a follow-up visit (if they are still in the hospital) or a telephone call will be completed at Day 28 (or later) to determine their mortality status. In surviving subjects, a follow-up visit or telephone call to determine their mortality status will also take place at approximately three months (i.e. Day 90) and 12 months after the subject was randomized."
