            "detailedDescription": "All participants will receive a one-time visit with the study physician. This visit will consist of a brief counseling session. Counseling sessions will last approximately 20 minutes and cover the 3 objectives of 1) review participants' motivation for smoking and for quitting; 2) use the information on participants' motives to provide tailored education regarding a) benefits of quitting smoking to the caregiver and the child, b) strategies to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms/urges to smoke during the hospitalization, and c) benefits of smoke-free home and car rules; and, 3) review smoking cessation resources.\n\nAfter the counseling session, participants will be provided a 2-week supply of nicotine patches and nicotine mini-lozenges, along with instructions for their use. The study physician will review how to use the medication, dosing, benefits of use, and potential side effects of use.\n\nWithin 24 hours of discharge, participants will be contacted to complete a post-intervention survey, which will assess nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use during the hospitalization and likelihood that the participant would recommend program implementation in the hospital. Smoking behavior during the child's hospitalization will be examined, including assessments of 1) number of cigarettes smoked per day and 2) number of times participant left the child's bedside to smoke per day. Participant's self-efficacy and interest in quitting smoking will be assessed, using the same questions from the pre-intervention survey, to assess for changes after the intervention.\n\nParticipants will be contacted 2 weeks after discharge with a link to complete the follow-up survey to again assess current smoking status, use of NRT post-hospitalization, self-efficacy and interest in quitting smoking, establishment of smoke-free home and car rules, and interest in ongoing smoking cessation treatment."
