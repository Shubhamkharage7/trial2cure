The study is being conducted in order to evaluate objective change in cognition and expressive language after implant and therapy with the Inspire UAS System.\n\nPrior to implant subjects will be required to meet eligibility criteria, complete quality of life questionnaires and undergo neurocognitive testing (NCT) and expressive language sampling. Eligibility criteria will be determined via review of medical records, an in-lab polysomnography (sleep study), and a drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE).\n\nAfter implant of the Inspire UAS System, subjects will undergo five (5) study visits. Four (4) of the visits will include an in-lab sleep study (PSG). Follow-up expressive language sampling and neurocognitive testing will be performed at 6 months post-implant. Follow-up quality of life questionnaires will be completed at 12 months post-implant.\n\nSubjects will conclude their participation in the study at the end of their 12 month study visit."
