The system will alert the participant and healthcare provider if it detects a possible infection so they can be formally diagnosed by their healthcare provider.\n\nFollowing enrollment, Study Participants will use the CloudCath System for 12 continuous months.\n\nStudy results from the ACT study will be compared to the results of the CATCH Study (Protocol number CC-P-001; NCT04515498). In CATCH, the Study Participants used a CloudCath System; however, the notification capabilities (per the CloudCath System algorithm) were deactivated."
