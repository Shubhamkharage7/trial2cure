            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a light electrical stimulation to leg muscles and joints can help people with Cerebral Palsy (CP) maintain balance during everyday tasks such as getting up from a chair and walking. Children and young adults with CP can have trouble with daily tasks such as standing up, sitting down on the chair and turning. The difficulty in maintaining balance sometimes lead to falls. This raises risk of disability in CP as children age into teens and adults. Current treatments are not very effective. In this study, children and young adults will be asked to stand up from a stool, walk in a straight line, turn, walk back and sit down on the stool. Participants will receive electrical stimulation at a very low intensity that cannot be felt to help increase their sensory perception. The investigators will evaluate treatment by testing balance, and other functional measures."
