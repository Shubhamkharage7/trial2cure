            "briefSummary": "Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by bacteria. This bacteria produces several toxins one of which is botulinum toxin A. This toxin causes the symptoms of food poisoning. Small amounts of botulinum toxin A have been used to treat speech disorders such as stuttering and problems with the muscles of the eyes.\n\nThe study examines the effectiveness of botulinum toxin as treatment for a variety of movement disorders. The goals of the study are to refine the technique of treatment to provide the best results, to improve the understanding of how botulinum toxin works on movement disorders, and find other conditions that may be treatable with botulinum toxin.\n\nIn addition, researchers also plan to study the possible use of botulinum toxin F alone and in combination with botulinum toxin A in patients who do not respond to botulinum A toxin treatment.\\<TAB\\>",
            "detailedDescription": "The efficacy of botulinum toxin (BTX) has now been demonstrated for a variety of diseases associated with involuntary muscles spasms or movement. The application of botulinum toxin therapy to movement disorders requires treatment tailored to the individual patient and specific techniques of injection. This protocol 1) allows us to follow the natural history of subjects with movement disorders who receive standard botox injections for treatment of movement disorders and 2) allows us to provide botulinum toxin injections for patients participating in other studies on the physiology of sensorimotor systems and on the physiological effects of botulinum toxin."
