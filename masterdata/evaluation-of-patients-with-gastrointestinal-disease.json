            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nOngoing and future research projects that study gastrointestinal diseases depend on access to biological samples and clinical data. Researchers want to study people who are seen and treated for these diseases. This may help them assess and treat these diseases better in the future.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect data and samples from people being seen and/or treated for gastrointestinal problems at NIH, to use in future research.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 and older who have known or suspected gastrointestinal disorders or need screening, treatment, or follow-up per current medical guidelines.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical exam. Their medical records will be reviewed.\n\nParticipants will be seen by doctors based on the ailment they have. Their condition will be treated just like it would at a doctor s office. But the data and samples collected will be used for future research.\n\nParticipants may give blood, urine, and/or stool samples.\n\nIf participants have an endoscopy or colonoscopy as part of their standard care and samples are taken, they may be asked to give their leftover samples to NIH. Or, they may be asked to have extra samples taken for NIH to use. These samples may include gastric acid and/or tissue from the lining of the stomach or intestines. If samples are not taken as part of their standard care, they may be asked to have samples taken for NIH to use.\n\nData will be stored at NIH. The data systems are password protected. Samples will be coded.\n\nParticipants will take part in the study for as long as they agree to be seen for their disease....",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients with suspected or established acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases or who require clinical screening for gastrointestinal diseases are provided standard clinical care for their condition. Data and samples obtained during regular clinical care will be retained for future research in gastrointestinal diseases. Recommendations for other treatment options outside of the NIH will be discussed with study patients and may be discussed with their primary or referring physicians."
