            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: discontinuation of dupilumab; reduction of dupilumab dose; or continuation of standard dupilumab dose. During the active study treatment period, participants will be asked to complete 5 study visits. At these visits, a physician will conduct a skin examination to assess atopic dermatitis (AD) severity and participants will complete questionnaires about their AD symptoms and severity. During the observational period, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their AD symptoms and medication use every twelve weeks, for a total of 3 follow-up contacts. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of reducing or discontinuing dupilumab in children with well-controlled AD."
