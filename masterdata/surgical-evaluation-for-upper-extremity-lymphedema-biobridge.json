The Class II device was cleared by CDRH Division of Surgical Devices on 8 January 2016 under 510(k) K151083.\n\nThe study will investigate whether addition of the BioBridge Collagen Matrix to the standard surgery for vascularized lymph node transfer will improve the outcome of surgical treatment in lymphedema of the upper extremity. This clinical study will also be used in support of IDE G200200 review conducted by the FDA.\n\nPrimary endpoint is the post surgical % change in excess limb volume, measured at 12 months following the surgical procedure.\n\nSecondary endpoints are change in quality of life scores measured by LLIS and change in lymphatic function as measured by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging."
