            "briefSummary": "The aim of the study is to compare the effect of CirrhosisRx, a novel clinical decision support (CDS) system for inpatient cirrhosis care, versus \"usual care\" on adherence to national quality measures and clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.",
            "detailedDescription": "Each year, there over 200,000 hospitalizations for cirrhosis in the United States. Over one-third of these patients are readmitted within 30 days, and up to 10% will die in the hospital. Despite national quality measures and care guidelines, cirrhosis care remains suboptimal and highly variable.\n\nClinical Decision Support (CDS) systems present an attractive strategy to improve guideline-adherence due to low implementation costs. These systems, however, remain largely untested in cirrhosis care and it remains unknown whether they are effective at improving guideline-adherence and whether improving guideline-adherence changes clinical outcomes in cirrhosis care. The investigators have designed \"CirrhosisRx,\" a cirrhosis-specific CDS system, to address these evidence gaps.\n\nThis study intends to compare effect of CirrhosisRx versus \"usual care\" on adherence to quality measures and clinical outcomes through a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT). Randomization will be based on stepped-wedge cluster randomization of treatment teams at our institution."
