The hypothesis is that this combination is effective and will produce a CR rate of 80%. DA-EPOCH and Mogamulizumab will be administered for 6 cycles and depending on the histology, consolidative strategies including SCT will be considered. Response assessments will occur at pre-specified intervals. Dose adjustments for specific toxicities with drugs are detailed in the protocol. Based on statistical analysis, a maximum of 36 patients will need to be accrued to evaluate for disease response based on historical control."
