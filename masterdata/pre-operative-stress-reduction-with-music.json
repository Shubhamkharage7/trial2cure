            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of music, played prior to a surgical procedure, on stress levels during induction of anesthesia. Hypothesis: playing \"calming\" music, pre-selected by the investigator and the patient, beginning just prior to induction and terminating after induction will positively reduce the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate during this period. For this study, noise-cancelling headphones with the ability to play music via an iPod will be utilized.",
            "detailedDescription": "Reduced stress and relaxation positively contribute to patient healing after surgery (1). Reduction of stress associated with surgery is even more important in children, for whom a traumatic experience can have even more damaging and long-lasting effects (2). One stress-reduction technique of current interest is music. In global studies outside of the surgical realm, music has been shown to reduce heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and stress hormone levels as well as alleviate anxiety (3).\n\nEvidence has also been found that listening to music pre-operatively in both adult and pediatric cases can reduce patients' stress and anxiety levels before surgery (3,7) Of the studies that have addressed the benefits of pre-operative music, however, none have assessed the impact of pre-operative music on stress levels during induction. In addition, almost all prior studies of the benefits of perioperative music have assessed the effect of only one style of music on each patient group. This set-up is beneficial in eliminating variables within the study design, but it fails to consider the individuality of each patient and what he/she might find to be relaxing. This study aims to assess the effect of music (selected by the pediatric patient from one of several pre-compiled playlists) played pre-operatively and during induction on patient stress levels."
