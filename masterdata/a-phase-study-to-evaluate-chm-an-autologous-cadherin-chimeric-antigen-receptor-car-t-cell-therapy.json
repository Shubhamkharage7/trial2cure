            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study to evaluate CHM-2101, an autologous CDH17 CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers that are relapsed or refractory to at least 1 standard treatment regimen in the metastatic or locally advanced setting.\n\nThe study has 2 parts: Phase 1, Dose Escalation and Expansion, and Phase 2. Potential participants will provide written consent and be screened for study eligibility prior to undergoing any screening procedures, including leukapheresis. Protocol-specified criteria must be met prior to the start of leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Eligible participants will undergo leukapheresis to collect PBMCs for product manufacturing, which comprises enrichment of T cells, lentiviral transduction, ex vivo expansion, and cryopreservation of the CHM-2101 cell product. Participants who have a leukapheresis or manufacturing failure may be permitted a second attempt at leukapheresis.\n\nBridging chemotherapy (treatment between the time of leukapheresis and first dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy \\[LDC\\]) is permitted at the discretion of the investigator, if needed to maintain disease stability during CHM-2101 manufacturing time. Bridging chemotherapy is prohibited within the 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis and 2 weeks prior to planned CHM-2101 infusion. Specific criteria to proceed should be reviewed prior to leukapheresis, LDC, and CHM-2101 infusion. Participants will be followed in this study for 18 months or until disease progression."
