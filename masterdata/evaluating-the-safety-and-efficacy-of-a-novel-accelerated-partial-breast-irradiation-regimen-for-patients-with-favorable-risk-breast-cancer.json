APBI is a treatment option available to women considered to have an early stage, low-risk breast cancer. The standard external beam-based APBI treatment delivers treatments every other day for five treatments, over ten calendar days. The APBI in this study is modified and will deliver five once daily treatments over consecutive treatment days, with a slightly lower dose of radiation each day as compared to the standard external beam-based APBI treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective interventional cohort study in breast cancer participants. The purpose of this study is to track physician-assessed cosmetic outcomes as the primary study endpoint, and compare these results to historical trials in which women with favorable risk early stage breast cancer underwent a course of adjuvant WBI."

The sentinel lymph node(s) must be negative for regionally metastatic disease, both on routine H\\&E evaluation and immunohistochemical staining. Axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS.\n* Absence of lymphovascular space invasion.\n* The tumor must be positive for either the presence of the estrogen or progesterone receptor, and either 0 or +1 for the HER-2/neu receptor on immunohistochemical staining.\n* The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated and the target lumpectomy cavity to the whole breast reference volume ratio must be \u2264 30% based on the CT-simulation scan.\n* Life expectancy of 5 years or longer excluding breast cancer diagnosis(co-morbid conditions taken into considerations by the PI)\n* Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before their CT simulation, and must agree to use an effective method of birth control during their radiation therapy treatment course.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception.\n* Nuclear grade 3 DCIS or Nottingham grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma.\n* Invasive lobular carcinoma, any grade.\n* Male sex.\n* Any treatment with radiation therapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study enrollment\n* Prior breast or thoracic radiation treatment for any reason.\n* History of prior invasive breast cancer or DCIS.
