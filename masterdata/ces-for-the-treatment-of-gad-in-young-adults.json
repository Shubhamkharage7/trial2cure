            "detailedDescription": "This study examines (1) the efficacy of CES with the Alpha-Stim AID \u00ae for the treatment of GAD in young adults (18-21 years of age) in a double-blind, sham-controlled parallel group single-site clinical trial of 130 participants.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into receiving either active CES (at least 200uA, up to 500uA at 0.5Hz, 60 minutes daily for six weeks) or sham CES with the Alpha-Stim AID \u00ae device at-home. Clinical assessments of anxiety symptoms are performed at Screening (for eligibility), Baseline, Follow-Up 1 (at completion of intervention, 6 weeks after initial stimulation), and Follow-Up 2 (12 weeks after initial stimulation). Additional assessments of depression symptoms and quality of life are included. Resting-state EEG will be collected at baseline and Follow-Up 1 (in up to 60 participants) for exploratory investigation of mechanism of action."
