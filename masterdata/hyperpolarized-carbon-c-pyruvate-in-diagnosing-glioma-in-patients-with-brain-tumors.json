To establish a clinical infrastructure for performing hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate (hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate) imaging in the human brain at MD Anderson.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the correlation between conversion rate of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate (kpl) values and Ki-67 quantitation in the tumor.\n\nII. To compare kpl values between tumor and normal brain within patient. III. To assess the association between kpl values and pathology results, including conventional, diffusion, perfusion, and permeability imaging.\n\nIV. To assess the association between kpl values and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings.\n\nV. To assess the association between kpl values and genomic findings, including methylation, ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\], and deoxyribonucleic acid \\[DNA\\]).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 10-20 seconds and then undergo an MRSI scan.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 day."

To reduce heterogeneity in the patient population we will not consider patients younger than 18 for this study.\n* Patient is a candidate for cerebral tumor resection with lesion suspected to be or previously biopsy proven to be a primary brain tumor.\n* Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study.\n* Patient agrees to undergo, prior to the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, within 14 days and preferably with 3 days of the planned procedure) with perfusion, diffusion and spectroscopic imaging.\n* Patient has a GFR \\> 60. In patients with moderate renal failure (GFR 30-60), an alternate injection with 2 times half-dose multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine) or gadovist (gadobutrol) will be considered, if a contrast exam is deemed clinically necessary.\n* Specifically for this Study: Patient is willing to give signed informed consent for C13-Pyruvate MR Spectroscopy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Healthy volunteers will be screened using same process but will otherwise not be subject to other selection criteria.\n* The patient is found to have unfavorable anatomy to indicate that stereotactic biopsy could not be safely performed.\n* Pacemakers, electronic stimulation, metallic foreign bodies and devices and/or other conditions that are not MR safe, which include but are not limited to: \u2022 electronically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants \u2022 ferromagnetic or electronically operated active devices like automatic cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac pacemakers \u2022 metallic splinters in the eye \u2022 ferromagnetic hemostatic clips in the central nervous system (CNS) or body \u2022 cochlear implants \u2022 other pacemakers, e.g., for the carotid sinus \u2022 insulin pumps and nerve stimulators \u2022 non-MR safe lead wires \u2022 prosthetic heart valves (if dehiscence is suspected) \u2022 non-ferromagnetic stapedial implants \u2022 pregnancy \u2022 claustrophobia that does not readily respond to oral medication\n* Prior brain tumor treatment, including surgical resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy for a primary brain neoplasm. Previous biopsy will not disqualify the patient from participation. Remote history (\\> 6month) of non-CNS malignancy in remission, without evidence of current/ prior brain metastasis, will also not disqualify patient from participating.\n* History of cardiac arrhythmia",
