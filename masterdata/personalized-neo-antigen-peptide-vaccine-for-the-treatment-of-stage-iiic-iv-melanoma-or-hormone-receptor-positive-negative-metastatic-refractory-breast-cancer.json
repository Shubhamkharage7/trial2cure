Personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine is a product combines multiple patient specific neo-antigens. Given personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine together with Th1 polarizing adjuvant poly ICLC may induce a polyclonal, poly-epitope, cytolytic T cell immunity against the patient's tumor.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive poly ICLC intramuscularly (IM) once weekly in weeks when no vaccine is given. Beginning 2 weeks after starting poly ICLC, patients receive personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine IM once every 4 weeks and nivolumab every 2 or 4 weeks. Treatment continuous for 25 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab every 2 or 4 weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24, 36, and 48 weeks."

Patients with controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen may be eligible. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., no psoriatic arthritis) may be eligible\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, prednisone \\>= 10 mg/day or equivalent, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and TNF-alpha antagonists) within 2 weeks prior screening. The use of topical, eye drops, local injections, or inhaled corticosteroids (e.g. fluticasone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is allowed. The use of oral mineralocorticoids (e.g. fludrocortisone for patients with orthostatic hypotension) is allowed. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency are allowed. Low dose corticosteroids for a short duration \\[5 mg once daily (QD) prednisone for 2 weeks\\] as symptomatic treatment and upon with discussion with the investigator is allowed. Note: Patients with adrenal insufficiency may take 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily\n* Subjects should have an INR or aPTT \u22641.5 X ULN unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy. Subjects on anticoagulant therapy should have a PT or PTT within therapeutic range of intended use and no history of severe hemorrhage. Antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.) are not considered anticoagulants for the purposes of this study (i.e., they are allowed)\n* Other medical, social, or psychiatric factor that interferes with medical appropriateness and/or ability to comply with study, as determined by the principal investigator (PI)\n* Participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to enrollment. Childbearing potential is defined as women who have not been surgically sterilized and who are not post-menopausal (free of menses for at least 1 year)\n* Female patients who are lactating or intend to breastfeed during the duration of the study\n* Patients who have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment\n* Patients with any underlying medical condition for which, in the investigator's opinion, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g.- compromises the health of the subject) or that could prevent, limit or confound protocol assessments\n* MELANOMA SPECIFIC: Uveal or Choroidal melanoma. This entity is excluded due to the absence of abundant mutations\n* BREAST SPECIFIC: Patients with symptomatic disease including patients with symptomatic lung metastases, bone marrow replacement with associated cytopenia, or significant liver metastases with associated liver dysfunction",
