The overall objective of this proposed project is to investigate the sensitivity and direction of change in cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and the magnitude difference between the first two harmonics of the voice spectrum (H1-H2) in response to varied phonation patterns, which will be addressed using the following two aims:\n\nAim 1: Determine how CPP and H1-H2 change as a function of using pressed voice production in individuals without laryngeal pathology.\n\nAim 2: Examine the sensitivity (minimally detectable change) and responsiveness (minimal clinically important difference) of CPP and H1-H2 to detect changes in different voice production conditions."
