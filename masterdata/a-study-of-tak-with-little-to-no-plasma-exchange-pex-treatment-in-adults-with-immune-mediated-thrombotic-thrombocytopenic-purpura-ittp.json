The main aim of this study is to determine the percentage of participants with a clinical response without plasma exchange during the study. Participants who have an acute attack of iTTP will receive TAK-755 and immunosuppressive therapy during their stay at the hospital until they achieve a clinical response. Participants will also be treated with TAK-755 for an additional time of up to 6 weeks after the acute phase. In total, participants will stay in the study for approximately 3 months."
