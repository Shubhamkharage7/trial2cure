            "detailedDescription": "This is a pilot a pilot cross-sectional study to evaluate the utility of TMS-derived biomarkers in PTE prediction and detection. We will measure motor cortex excitability and intracortical inhibition (see below) in TBI patients with PTE (Group 1), TBI patients with average 30% risk of developing PTE who have not yet developed PTE (Group 2) and healthy age- and sex-matched control participants (group 3). 10 adult subjects aged 18-70 will be recruited into each group. We shall obtain a range of TMS metrics in each individual (see below), and, per metric, compare average values among groups by 1-way ANOVA. Our specific hypothesis is that, relative to healthy control, motor cortex TMS measures will indicate increased cortical excitability in participants with PTE, and a trend toward same in patients with TBI who have not developed PTE For subjects in groups 2 and 3, all antiseizure treatments will be stable (unchanged) for 4 weeks prior to evaluation. Subjects will undergo two ppTMS testing separated by 1-2 weeks. Per participant, TMS metrics (see below), will be evaluated for test-retest reliability (our secondary outcome measure)"
