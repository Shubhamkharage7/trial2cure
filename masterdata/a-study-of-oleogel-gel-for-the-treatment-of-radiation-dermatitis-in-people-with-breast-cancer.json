Oleogel-S10 has shortened the healing time for other types of skin wounds such as burns. Triamcinolone is a cream that is frequently used to treat moderate to severe skin conditions such as skin irritation caused by poison ivy, eczema, sunburn, and rashes."

Once patient is enrolled on study (on or before Day 1), patient must be able to discontinue other topicals (including topical steroids, Silvadene, calcineurin inhibitors) to the treatment area\n* Patients have completed surgery or chemotherapy \u2265 4 weeks prior to start of radiation therapy. Patients may receive antibody-drug conjugates at any time before/during/after study\n* Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline (Day 0) and documented monthly.\n* WCBP must agree to abstrain from sex or use a highly effective method of birth control\\* from the time of consent through visit 5.\n\n  * Adequate contraceptive methods include those with a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly, such as abstinence from sexual intercourse, and some double barrier methods (condom with spermicide) in conjunction with use by the partner of an intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, birth control patch or vaginal ring, or injectable or implanted contraceptives. Abstinence is acceptable only as true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\nA woman that is postmenopausal (\u22652 years since last menstrual period) or permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) is not considered a WCBP.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving radiation therapy for inflammatory breast cancer or malignant fungating wound\n* Known history of allergy to any ingredient of the study medication\n* Patients with collagen-vascular disease/vasculitis\n* Patients receiving hypofractionated radiation therapy\n* Special populations:\n\n  * patients who, in the opinion of the investigator have a condition that precludes their ability to provide an informed consent",
