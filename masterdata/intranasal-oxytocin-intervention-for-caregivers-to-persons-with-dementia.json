            "briefSummary": "The proposed study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of intranasal oxytocin (OXT) to determine its efficacy in improving quality of life and reducing stress in caregivers to persons with dementia. Planned enrollment is 32 participants over 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intranasal oxytocin (OXT) to improve the quality of life and reduce chronic stress levels in the caregivers to the persons with dementia. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of intranasal oxytocin (12 or 24 IU) will be conducted by daily administration (once a day) for 21 days (3 weeks).\n\nEndogenous neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been a focus of prior psychiatric research based upon its role in pro-social behavior and modulation of response to social/emotional stimuli. However, currently there is no comprehensive study examining its role in the caregivers to chronic medical/psychiatric illnesses including dementia for potential beneficial impact as well as reducing chronic stress levels.\n\nThe current study aims to establish intranasal OXT's efficacy and safety for these clinical implications. Investigators will also apply methods (task related functional MRI) that have shown verifiable and measurable ability to capture the core target area (mPFC and amygdala) and its change in response to OXT.\n\nThis project will lead to progress in understanding the potential role of OXT on the relationship between caregiver and the person with chronic medical/psychiatric illnesses such as dementia. It will also guide future direction for clinical use of intranasal OXT for this critical population."
