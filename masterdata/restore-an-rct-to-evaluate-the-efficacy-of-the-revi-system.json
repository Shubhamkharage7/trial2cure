At this time the Revi System will be activated to begin therapy and will continue for the duration of the study.\n\nRandomization in a 1:2 ratio into either the \"control group\" or the \"treatment group\" will be performed in blocks of 3 or 6 randomly, across the study population by a central randomization system. Randomization will be stratified by investigational site.\n\nThe study will consist of the following activities:\n\nVisit 1 - Screening\n\n* Potential subjects with UUI, who fulfil basic criteria will be informed of the study and will be invited to sign an informed consent form.\n* Demographic information (age, race, height and weight, leg circumference), medical and surgical history and concomitant medication information will be collected.\n* Study candidates will be asked to fill out various questionnaires\n* Patients will be asked to complete a 3- consecutive day voiding diary.\n* Urine sample will be collected, blood will be drawn and a full physical examination, including a PVR measurement and uroflow (in men), will be performed.\n\nVisit 2 - Randomization \\& Implantation\n\n* 5 \u00b1 4 weeks after starting the diary, eligible subjects will be randomized to either the Treatment or Control (delayed activation) arms (2:1) and will undergo unilateral implantation with the BlueWind Revi System\n* Collection of AE and concomitant medication will be performed\n\nTreatment Arm:\n\nVisit 3 - Activation\n\n* After a recovery period of 4-weeks post implantation, subjects will attend the clinic to undergo physical examination and surgical wound check-up.\n* Subjects will undergo parameter setting according to the individual patient sensations and will be trained on the use of the system.\n\nVisits 4-11 - Treatment optimization and follow up\n\n* Follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months post system activation.\n* A call visit will be performed at 18-months.\n* All follow-up visits will require completion of a 3-day voiding diary by the patient before coming to the visit.\n* During each clinic visit, stimulation parameters and level of treatment will be checked and adjusted as needed.\n\nControl Arm:\n\n\u2022 After a recovery period of 1-month post implantation, subjects will attend the clinic to undergo physical examination and surgical wound check-up.\n\nVisit 4 - Activation\n\n* After a recovery period of 4-weeks post implantation, subjects will attend the clinic to undergo physical examination and surgical wound check-up.\n* Subjects will undergo parameter setting according to the individual patient sensations and will be trained on the use of the system.\n\nVisits 5-12 - Treatment optimization and follow up\n\n* Follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months post system activation.\n* A call visit will be performed at 18-months.\n* All follow-up visits will require completion of a 3-day voiding diary by the patient before coming to the visit.\n* During each clinic visit, stimulation parameters and level of treatment will be checked and adjusted as needed."
