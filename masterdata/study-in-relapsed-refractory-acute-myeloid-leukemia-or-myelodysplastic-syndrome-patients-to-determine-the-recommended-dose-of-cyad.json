A maximum of 27 r/r AML/MDS patients will be evaluated in this study in case of no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and no replacement of patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "This open-label phase I, multi-center study aims to determine in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome patients the recommended dose of CYAD-02 after a non-myeloablative preconditioning chemotherapy followed by a potential CYAD-02 consolidation cycle for non-progressive patients.\n\nDuring dose escalation, three prespecified dose-levels of CYAD-02 will be evaluated in three cohorts. Patient enrollment during dose-escalation will be staggered according to the Fibonacci 3+3 design and extension of cohorts II and III will be done in parallel. The first CYAD-02 infusion will be administered after prior non-myeloablative preconditioning chemotherapy (CYFLU) administered on three consecutive days.\n\nNon-progressive patients meeting the criteria specified below may receive a consolidation cycle with three additional CYAD-02 infusions at a 2-week interval without prior preconditioning.\n\nFor all patients who received at least one CYAD-02 infusion, the overall study duration will be approximately 15 years."
