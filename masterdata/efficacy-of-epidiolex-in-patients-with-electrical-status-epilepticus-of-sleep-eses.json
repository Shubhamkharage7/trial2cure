ESES is characterized by sleep potentiated spikes with a spike index greater than 85% (conventional definition) and 50% (new definition)1. Several drugs including: steroids, intravenous Gama globulin, Clobazam, other benzodiazepines, Valproic acid, and other anti-epileptic drugs have been tried with mixed benefits2,3. Cannabidiol (CBD) would provide a novel mechanism of action to assess for its efficacy in this population. This will be a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study attempts to view the effect of Epidiolex on subjects with Electrical Status Epilepticus of Sleep (ESES). ESES can cause various types of seizures which can fluctuate during sleep. Similar studies have been conducted with Epidiolex with other seizure disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet Syndrome. Since there is no data available on the effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) on patients with ESES, this study hopes to fill that void. As such, patients that have been diagnosed with ESES will be eligible to participate in this study to ascertain whether or not Epidiolex can reduce the frequency or intensity of the seizures brought on by ESES during sleep."
