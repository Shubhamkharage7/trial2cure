Specifically, it will determine the effect of the interval after transplantation on the immune response and if an additional dose of vaccine is needed to improve the vaccine-induced responses.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase II, single center, prospective, unblinded, immunogenicity and safety study. It is anticipated that enrollment will take approximately 6 months. Duration of participation for study subjects is approximately 1 year. During this interval, participants will continue to receive clinical care from the BMT center, which will ensure retention.\n\nParticipants will be recruited at their routine clinic visits, which take place every 6 months post-transplantation, or will be recruited by phone. Participants will be consented by study personnel in coordination with the BMT health care providers and subsequently followed in Dr. Levin's Vaccine Research Clinic, where they will also receive the 3rd dose of vaccine."
