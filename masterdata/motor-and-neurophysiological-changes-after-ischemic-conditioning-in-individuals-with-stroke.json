            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test ischemic conditioning (blood flow restriction) as a neuromodulatory technique to improve gait function in stroke. Neuromodulation is emerging as a promising adjunct strategy to facilitate changes in brain activity and improve motor behavior following a neurological injury such as stroke.\n\nThe main questions this trial aims to answer are:\n\n* Can ischemic conditioning produce neuromodulatory changes in the lower limb primary motor cortex?\n* Can ischemic conditioning be used as a neuromodulatory technique to improve strength, motor control, and gait speed in individuals with stroke when compared to sham ischemic conditioning?\n\nParticipants will take part in two sessions of ischemic conditioning where a cuff (similar to ones that measure blood pressure) will be placed around the thigh and inflated to one of two blood flow restriction pressures (real or sham). Each participant will experience measures of brain activity and motor behavior testing before and after both sessions (ischemic conditioning and sham ischemic conditioning).\n\nResearchers will investigate ischemic conditioning as neuromodulation modality in stroke to see if ischemic conditioning can produce beneficial changes in brain activity and improvements on subsequent motor behavior tasks."
