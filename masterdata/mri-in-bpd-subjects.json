            "detailedDescription": "This is an observational case study involving up to three MRI visits. The first MRI will be complete after the infant's clinical initial evaluation. The second image will be obtained approximately 1 month later and the third MRI will be complete prior to discharge. Infants will be imaged at various ages, based up their initial evaluation. The investigators will collect urine and obtain clinically collected remnant blood around time of MRI, tracheal/endotracheal aspirate at time of the MRI when available and BAL samples as clinically available. MRI findings will be correlated with laboratory findings and outcomes from the medical record, and a research database will be built for the data. The investigators will also obtain a one-time MRI visit in non-BPD NICU patients to acquire data related to normal vasculature and pulmonary alveolar development.\n\nSub-study 1: Inpatient polysomnography Patients with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as reported below will be approached for a brief inpatient polysomnogram. The population will include patients with and without BPD. The polysomnography (PSG) will be performed in the NICU within 1 week from the MRI that is obtained prior to discharge."
