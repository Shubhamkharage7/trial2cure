            "briefSummary": "The overarching goal of this project is to critically evaluate the efficacy of incorporating dietary guidance within multiple sclerosis (MS) care for improving long-term quality of life (QoL) compared to usual care. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of two dietary interventions (time restricted olive oil based (TROO) ketogenic and modified Paleolithic elimination) on MS QoL compared to usual care control (Dietary Guidelines for America), and the secondary objectives and the long-term effects on, motor function, low-contrast vision sensitivity, fatigue, mood, and disease activity assessed by brain imaging.",
            "detailedDescription": "In the United States, MS affects nearly 1 million people with a 2.8:1 female to male ratio and the highest incidence rates among whites and African Americans. The economic cost of managing MS is substantial. In the U.S., the total medical costs for patients with MS increased from $116 million in 2002 to $198 million in 2013. MS is a chronic, neuroinflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease-causing symptoms of pain, fatigue, and changes in vision, cognition, and movement that greatly reduce quality of life (QoL) and the ability to maintain employment.\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to critically evaluate the efficacy of incorporating dietary guidance within multiple sclerosis (MS) care for improving long-term quality of life (QoL) compared to usual care. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of two dietary interventions (time restricted olive oil based (TROO) ketogenic and modified Paleolithic elimination) on MS QoL compared to usual care control (Dietary Guidelines for America), and the secondary objectives and the long-term effects on, motor function, low-contrast vision sensitivity, fatigue, mood, and disease activity assessed by brain imaging.\n\nThe proposed study will consist of study participants attending 3 in-person site visits, months 0, 3, and 24, and online surveys every 3 months (months 0-24).\n\nThis study will use a randomized single-blind controlled design to test the short-term (6 months) and long-term (an additional 18 months) impact of the intervention diets on symptoms of MS including QoL and related outcomes stated above. We will use a fourteen-day run-in period to identify participants who are most likely to be successful in completing study procedures; this process has been effective in our previous studies. Participants who successfully complete all baseline self-reported outcomes and follow all study procedures during the seven-day run-in period will be scheduled for an on-site baseline visit for randomization to one of three diets (time restricted olive oil based (TROO) ketogenic and modified Paleolithic elimination and Dietary Guidelines for America).\n\nOn-site study visits will include blood draws, motor, cognitive, vision function assessments, and MRI. Motor assessments will include a 6-minute walk test, 25-foot walk test, 9-hole pegboard to test hand function, symbol digit exercise to test thinking functions, and critical flicker fusion test, ocular coherence tomography and low contrast vision sensitivity to test vision. The study participant will be escorted to the MRI unit to complete a non-contrast MRI of the brain. At the baseline visit, participants will be randomized. Participants assigned to the intervention diets will be given intervention specific educational materials including shopping lists, example menus and recipes, and the study supplements. Study participants randomized to the dietary guidelines for Americans diet will receive emails and/or text messages (approximately 3-6 weeks) to receive resources with websites for the Dietary Guidelines of America, and recent multiple sclerosis-related research that does not involve diet.\n\nStudy team will provide fish oil, essential fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine to the two intervention groups only. The participant will be scheduled for a Zoom video conference meeting with the assigned registered dietitian to review the assigned study diet.\n\nIn addition, subjects will collect saliva specimens for microbiome analysis at each of the 2 site study visits (month 0 and 24).\n\n24-hour dietary recalls will be collected by a study registered dietitian (RD) (who did not provide training on the respective participants assigned study diet) on three non-consecutive days at baseline, and one per month, at months 10-12, and 22-24. Participants will be given a 3-month window to complete dietary recalls in the event of scheduling conflicts. Participants will be instructed to record key study diet components each day using a study specific questionnaire in the study related (MyCap) application on their smart device.\n\nThe online questionnaires sent to participants every 2 months will also be used to track supplement intake, medication use, and details about health \\& life events, MS symptoms, fatigue, quality of life, doctor's appointment, and side effects they may be experiencing."
