            "briefSummary": "Less than half of all positive fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)s are followed-up by colonoscopy, thus limiting the full potential of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to reduce mortality. Given the need for coordination in order to achieve high rates of follow-up, multilevel approaches are needed. Such approaches could be particularly beneficial in communities and populations that experience cancer disparities and have fewer specialty providers, but most data focuses on large systems or urban areas. The academic-community health system collaboration is uniquely poised to address this research and service gap. The persistent poverty and health disparities in rural Southern Illinois set the stage for truly impactful research. The investigators' approach will serve as a model for multilevel interventions in rural settings, inform future work addressing other health disparities, and fill a gap in rigorous trials of CRC screening follow-up in rural areas."
