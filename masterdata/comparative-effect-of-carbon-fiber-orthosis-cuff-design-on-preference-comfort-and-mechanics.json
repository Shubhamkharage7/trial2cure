            "briefSummary": "Carbon fiber custom dynamic orthoses (CDOs) consist of a proximal cuff that wraps around the leg just below the knee, a posterior carbon fiber strut that stores and returns energy during gait, and a carbon fiber foot plate that supports the foot and allows bending of the posterior strut. The proximal cuff is a primary interface between the patient and the CDO and may influence comfort, preference, limb mechanics and loading, and effective stiffness of the CDO. The important role of the proximal cuff has not been examined. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of CDO proximal cuff design on patient reported outcomes, limb mechanics and loading, and CDO mechanical characteristics.",
            "detailedDescription": "Traumatic lower limb injuries often result in poor functional outcomes with long-term negative effects. Carbon fiber custom dynamic orthoses (CDOs) can improve outcomes by reducing pain, supporting the limb, and transferring forces around the limb through the CDO. CDOs consist of a proximal cuff that wraps around the leg just below the knee, a posterior carbon fiber strut that stores and returns energy during gait, and a carbon fiber foot plate that supports the foot and allows bending of the posterior strut. The proximal cuff is a primary interface between the patient and the CDO and may influence comfort, preference, limb mechanics and loading, and effective stiffness of the CDO. Although CDOs are becoming more commonly prescribed following injury the evidence available to guide clinical practice remains limited. The important role of the proximal cuff has not been systematically examined.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the effects of CDO proximal cuff design on patient reported outcomes, limb mechanics and loading, and CDO mechanical characteristics. Two groups of individuals will participate: individuals with post-traumatic osteoarthritis in the ankle and healthy individuals. Testing will occur without an orthosis and while wearing orthoses with four proximal cuff designs representative of currently available devices: 1) a rigid patellar tendon bearing (PTB) clamshell cuff secured using a mechanical ratcheting system, 2) a PTB shell with a fixed pivot point secured with Velcro, 3) a rigid clamshell cuff secured with Velcro, and 4) a semi-rigid cuff with a flexible outer layer secured with Velcro."
