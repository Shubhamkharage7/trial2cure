The study includes skin biopsies to evaluate the effects of NanoDOX\u00ae Doxycycline Monohydrate Gel on wound healing after the ablative laser procedure. Study subjects will be asked to do two visits of approximately 4 hours over two weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "Effective topical delivery of any pharmaceutical agent requires small molecule drugs to penetrate the epidermis, yet the absorption of topical products through the epidermis is limited.\n\nIn this study, the investigators are looking for healthy volunteers who are eligible to help us to determine the safety and efficacy of ablative fractional laser therapy combined with NanoDOX. The investigators are doing the research to evaluate drug delivery of topical NanoDOX\u00ae Hydrogel following ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment and our secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of NanoDOX\u00ae for wound healing.\n\nSubjects will have a screening visit to determine eligibility, and 2 study visits when they will receive CO2 ablative fractional laser treatment, NanoDOX\u00ae Hydrogel application, and skin biopsies. Laser procedure will happen only during visit 1 and visit 2 will happen 2 days after visit 1. In total, 7 skin biopsies will be performed."
