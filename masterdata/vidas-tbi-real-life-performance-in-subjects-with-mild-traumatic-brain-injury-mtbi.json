BioM\u00e9rieux has now developed an automated assay for the measurement of serum Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase (UCH-L1), the VIDAS\u00ae TBI assay to fill out this unmet needs. The goal of the herein study is to generate real-world data and evidences to support the VIDAS\u00ae TBI performances.",
            "detailedDescription": "The assessment of severity of TBI patients is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the initial management in the ED includes performing a non-contrast brain Computed Tomography (CT) scan if the patient meets specific conditions. To date, real world data show that EDs would actually not follow guideline recommendations and a substantial CT overuse is observed. Management strategies are becoming more and more focused on selective CT use to effectively manage health care resources. Efforts have been made to optimize the indications for brain CT scan after mTBI. Although brain CT scan plays a central role after mTBI, there is an unmet clinical need for an objective tool to optimize indications for CT scan, reduce patient radiation exposure, and possibly predict patient outcome. Clinical Decision Rules for an initial CT-scan could be optimized by the use of an objective parameter easily and rapidly measured. This may be the place for serum biomarkers providing a quick and accurate assessment.
