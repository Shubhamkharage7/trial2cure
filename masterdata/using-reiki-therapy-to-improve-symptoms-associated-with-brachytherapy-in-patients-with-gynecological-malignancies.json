Questionnaires will be administered at various time points on the day of the participant's first brachytherapy treatment as well as at the three month follow-up time point.\n\nResearchers will compare the intervention (Reiki therapy) and control (usual care) groups to assess the impact of the Reiki therapy on anxiety, pain, state anxiety, depression, and physiological measurements."

Below is a general outline of the process of Reiki therapy, which may vary slightly depending on the needs of the recipient:\n\n* The patient will be in a quiet clinic room lying in the supine position with calming music playing and aromatherapy if the patient chooses.\n* The Reiki therapist will place their hands on or near the recipient's body. The Reiki therapist may use a series of hand positions that correspond to different energy centers in the body.\n* During the treatment, the practitioner channels energy into the recipient's body through their hands. The patient may feel a sense of warmth, tingling, or relaxation.\n* The Reiki therapist may use different techniques, such as hand movements or visualization.",
