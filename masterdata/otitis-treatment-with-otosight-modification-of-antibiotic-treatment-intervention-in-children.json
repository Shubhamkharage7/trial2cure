There will be three (3) periods of post-intervention assessment: 10 days (optional), 6 months, and 12 months.\n\nEligible subjects will be automatically enrolled (or invited to enroll) in the clinical trial and will receive information. Because this is a non-interference design, frontline care clinicians randomized to either arm will be asked to: (1) assess the presence or absence of fluid in the middle ear; (2) record a diagnosis; and (3) treat the patient as they would according to the information available to them.\n\nA separate retrospective historical matched control arm will also be conducted to analyze potential Hawthorne effect at a subset of collaborating practices or healthcare systems. Randomization of clinicians (and not children) will decrease contamination in the usual practice group (i.e., so clinicians are not asked to flip between intervention and usual care practices)."
