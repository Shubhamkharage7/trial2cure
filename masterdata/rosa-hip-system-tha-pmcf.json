A patient is considered a success if their intra-operative and/or post-operative full pelvis fluoroscopic or radiographic images show the postoperative acetabular inclination to be within this safe zone range.\n\nSecondary Objectives include the evaluation of safety and efficacy of this system and will include the assessment of common adverse events, physical exam findings, radiologic results, and patient reported outcome measures.\n\nData collection will occur at the following intervals: Pre-operative, Operative, 3-months, 1-year, and 2-years. Enrollment for the study is anticipated to last approximately 18 months. Allowing for 24 months of follow-up, the total estimated study time to final-patient final-visit will be approximately 42 months."
