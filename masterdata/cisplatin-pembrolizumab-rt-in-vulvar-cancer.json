            "briefSummary": "This research is being done to see how well the combination of a standard of care drug, investigational drug, and radiation therapy work against unresectable vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nThis research study involves the following:\n\n* Cisplatin (standard of care drug)\n* Pembrolizumab (investigational drug)\n* Radiation Therapy (standard of care intervention)",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm phase 2 clinical trial involving women with unresectable, incompletely resected, recurrent, or metastatic vulva squamous cell carcinoma. This study combines cisplatin, pembrolizumab, and radiation therapy to see if this combination further increases participants' immune system's efficiency in killing their tumor, and if the combination decreases the chances of participants' cancer coming back.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThis research study involves the following:\n\n* Cisplatin (standard of care drug)\n* Pembrolizumab (investigational drug)\n* Radiation Therapy (standard of care intervention)\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for up to 36 weeks and will be followed for up to 3 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 24 people will take part in this research study.\n\nPhase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved cisplatin as a treatment option for vulva squamous cell carcinoma. The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab for vulva squamous cell carcinoma, but it has been approved for other uses. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug and will be given to participants per standard of care.\n\nRadiation therapy will be given to you per standard of care. Pembrolizumab is a drug that may target participants immune systems to increase its efficiency in targeting and killing illnesses and diseases, such as unresectable vulvar squamous cell carcinoma."

Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Participants with vulvar melanomas, sarcomas, extramammary Paget's disease, or basal cell carcinoma\n* Participants with a history of gastrointestinal or colovesicular fistulae\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last five years. Patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy.\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required.\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n* Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because effects of agents used in this study on infants or the developing human fetus are unknown.\n* Presence of other malignancies unless they are considered cured by patient's oncologist.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).",
