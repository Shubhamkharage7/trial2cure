            "briefSummary": "Metoclopramide is a drug approved by the FDA for gastroesophageal reflux and to relieve symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. The objective of this study is to determine whether metoclopramide can improve hypoglycemia awareness and decrease the incidence of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes patients with hypoglycemia unawareness.",
            "detailedDescription": "Hypoglycemia is the most prevalent clinical complication in the daily management of diabetes and is the major obstacle to normalizing blood sugar. For people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF) increases the risk for severe hypoglycemia by a factor of 25 or more. A major component of HAAF is hypoglycemia unawareness (perhaps more accurately defined as impaired awareness of hypoglycemia), which involves in the loss/diminution of warning symptoms to hypoglycemia that would normally prompt a corrective behavioral response (e.g., eating food). Approximately 25-40% of people with T1DM report hypoglycemia unawareness. This value is most certainly an underestimation, as even people with diabetes who report having intact hypoglycemia, demonstrate impaired awareness of biochemically confirmed hypoglycemia. Although a major clinical problem for people with T1DM, it remains largely unknown what therapeutic agents could possibly be used to treat hypoglycemia unawareness.\n\nWith a goal of identifying existing biological compounds that could restore hypoglycemia awareness, laboratory drug screens were conducted using animal models. It was postulated that an ideal drug would markedly enhance the ability to sense hypoglycemia and trigger a potentially life-saving behavioral response (ie, alert the subject to increase food consumption). The vast majority of tested drugs did not restore hypoglycemia awareness (ie, did not restore blunted food intake response to hypoglycemia). Interestingly, of all the drugs tested, the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide consistently restored hypoglycemia awareness in several preclinical experiments. Additionally, metoclopramide also restored the impaired counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia in the animal model of HAAF.\n\nThis pilot phase II clinical trial (with placebo control) will be conducted to determine if FDA approved doses of Metaclopramdide can restore both, 1) hypoglycemia awareness, and 2) the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM and hypoglycemia unawareness."
