            "detailedDescription": "Proposed is a type I hybrid effectiveness/implementation study using a neighborhood-level, stepped-wedge trial design across six primarily Black/Latinx, socially vulnerable neighborhoods in New Haven. Residents of each neighborhood who have been affected by incarceration (i.e., currently have a family member incarcerated or a person returning to the community from prison within the last 12 months) will be eligible for our intervention for a period of 6 months. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) implementation science frameworks will be used to measure and track processes in achieving outcomes. A mixed methods approach will be used, primarily the use of quantitative methods for this study, along with qualitative focus groups will be conducted to assess some implementation outcomes. The primary outcome, rates of gun violence at the neighborhood level, are obtained from administrative data. Survey data will be collected for some implementation process measures (e.g., assessing acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention)."
