            "briefSummary": "The goal of the Self-monitoring With Internet Technology to Choose Healthy Diets (SWITCH) study is to examine a 12-week remotely delivered program designed to help adults adopt a healthy dietary lifestyle and lose weight in a diverse cohort of adults with overweight/obesity.\n\nThe intervention uses a self-determination theory framework to provide a deeper understanding of the factors that influence dietary behavior within the context of tracking. This study incorporates autonomy-supportive strategies to encourage participants to feel more in control of their dietary choices and will provide information and resources to boost participant's competence in achieving their dietary goals. The intervention includes weekly learning modules to support healthy eating and weight loss and daily dietary tracking with visual feedback, all accessible within the SWITCH app.",
            "detailedDescription": "The SWITCH study is a 12-week remotely delivered, randomized behavioral intervention. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) SWITCH tracking nutrients to decrease (n=50) or 2) SWITCH tracking nutrients to increase (n=50). Participants will attend a study orientation, complete all baseline measures, be randomized, and then attend a training session for their group. In addition, participants will complete assessment at baseline and 12 weeks.\n\nIntervention Design:\n\nDiet tracking. Participants in both groups will be asked to track all meals, snacks, and beverages via the SWITCH app and complete a weekly learning module. Both groups will receive the same intervention, but the targeted nutrient goals and the in-app display of daily intake will differ between groups. Participants will be given goals to either increase certain nutrients or to decrease certain nutrients.\n\nDiet related education to support healthy eating and weight loss will be provided each week within the SWITCH app. Each module includes some or all (as applicable) of the following components: A brief educational video discussing the week's topic, a video sharing ideas for applying the educational content into daily life, \"meal swap\" examples, a weekly goal or challenge and example recipes."
