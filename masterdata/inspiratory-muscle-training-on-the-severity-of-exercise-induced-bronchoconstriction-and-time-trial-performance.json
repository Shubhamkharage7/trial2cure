            "briefSummary": "Due to the lack of studies examining the impact of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on the severity of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and exercise performance, the specific aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of flow-resistive IMT on EIB severity and symptoms, short-acting beta-2-agonist medication use, operating lung volumes, respiratory and limb locomotor muscle deoxygenation during constant-load cycling exercise, exertional dyspnea, and cycling time-trial performance.",
            "detailedDescription": "To the investigators knowledge, no study has been conducted assessing the impact of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) severity, exertional dyspnea, and cycling time-trial performance. A review noted that studies examining the impact of IMT on asthma have all demonstrated an increase in inspiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory pressure, MIP) and endurance (sustained maximal inspiratory pressure). In addition, it has been observed that the reduction in the perception of dyspnea following and during exercise leads to a reduction in short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA) use and fewer asthma symptoms. The same review also noted the lack of data available to explain the impacts of IMT on exercise performance and tolerance in athletes with EIB. Due to the lack of studies examining the impact of IMT on the severity of EIB and exercise performance, the specific aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of flow-resistive IMT on EIB severity and symptoms, SABA medication use, operating lung volumes, respiratory and limb locomotor muscle deoxygenation during constant-load cycling exercise, femoral blood flow, exertional dyspnea, and cycling time-trial performance. It is hypothesized that eight weeks of IMT will reduce EIB's severity and symptoms, respiratory and limb locomotor muscle deoxygenation, improve operating lung volumes, and exertional dyspnea and improve cycling time-trial performance."
