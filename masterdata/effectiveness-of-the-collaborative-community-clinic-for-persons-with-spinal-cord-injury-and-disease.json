A separate IRB was approved to review outcomes from participants in the CCC to evaluate the effectiveness of the clinic. All participants participated in an informed consent process to provide the option to have their data stored in a data repository for aggregate review. If any participate chooses not to have their data stored, it will not be stored or outcomes reviewed. However, participants are still provided services through the CCC. Researchers anticipate up to 200 participants participating in the registry over five years. All data will be data checked by a member of the research team to limit errors and identification of missing data recorded. Statistical analysis methods are to be determined upon completion of the study."
