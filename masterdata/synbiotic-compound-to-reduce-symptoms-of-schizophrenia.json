Intestinal inflammation will be assessed through the measurement of antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gliadin, Candida albicans as well as high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein and Pentraxin-3. The duration of the trial is 14 weeks: after a 2-week placebo run in, the participants will be randomized to receive the synbiotic compound or identical-appearing placebo over the 12 weeks of the randomized phase. The synbiotic compound is a quality-tested product, Probio-Tec ABCG-Stick-25, manufactured by ChrHansen which contains 4 strains of probiotic microorganisms - Bifidobacteria BB-12, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus - and the prebiotic, inulin, a fructan-containing polysaccharide which has been shown to increase the level of non-pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. All participants will also be maintained on a stable regimen of psychiatric medications prescribed by their treating psychiatrist."
