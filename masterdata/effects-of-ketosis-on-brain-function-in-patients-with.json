            "briefSummary": "The scientific goal of this study is to examine the effects of a ketogenic diet on hypoglycemia tolerance and brain function in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and to clarify the mechanistic role of ketones in this process. Glycemic management of T1D is typified by alternating periods of hyper- and hypo-glycemia. Because brain metabolism under usual conditions depends on glucose, acute hypoglycemia leads to immediate complications including impaired cognitive function and a counter-regulatory hormone response. Recurrent hypoglycemia is associated with functional and structural changes in the brain and contributes to the cognitive decline observed in individuals with diabetes. The state of nutritional ketosis (as it occurs during fasting or when following a ketogenic \\[very low carbohydrate\\] diet) may protect against these acute and chronic complications. As the body relies on fat metabolism, ketone bodies build up and provide an alternative fuel for the brain. Studies during hypoglycemia have shown better cognitive function and less hypoglycemia symptoms in the setting of nutritional ketosis or with ketone administration. This physiological benefit may have special relevance for people with T1D who experience hypoglycemia frequently. To date, no mechanistic studies have examined brain effects of nutritional ketosis in T1D; nor have any trials explored the potential relevance of this for diabetes care.",
            "detailedDescription": "To test the hypothesis that a ketogenic diet increases hypoglycemia tolerance and improves brain function and cognitive performance during hypoglycemia, the researchers propose a randomized mechanistic study using insulin infusions and neuroimaging. The study will leverage an existing randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 32 young adults with T1D who will receive a ketogenic vs a standard carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks. Researchers will conduct a euglycemic-hypoglycemic insulin clamp using a continuous infusion of insulin, along with a glucose infusion that is adjusted to keep blood glucose levels normal (90 mg/dL), followed by a slow drop to hypoglycemia (50 mg/dL). Researchers will assess activation and connectivity of relevant brain areas by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using continuous imaging during the gradual glycemic descent from 90 mg/dL to 50 mg/dL, the researchers will establish the glycemic threshold at which the hypothalamus becomes activated. Using a combination of MRI modalities, they will assess brain activation and connectivity changes during hypoglycemia versus euglycemia, both during rest and in relation to a cognitive task. Brain findings will be integrated with physiologic (blood levels of glucose, ketones, free fatty acids, counter-regulatory hormones) and behavioral (reaction time, cognitive task performance, hypoglycemia symptoms scale) parameters. In additional studies, researchers will give an oral ketone drink to raise blood ketone levels in participants in the standard carbohydrate diet arm. They will perform the same insulin infusion and MRI investigations to clarify the mechanistic role of ketones in mediating brain activation patterns. Comparison will be between nutritional vs no ketosis, exogenous vs no ketosis, and nutritional vs exogenous ketosis."
