            "briefSummary": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) causes a persistent infection that ultimately leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Treatment of HIV-1 infection with combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV-1 replication to undetectable viral levels and saves lives. Nevertheless, ART cannot eradicate latent cellular reservoirs of the virus, and HIV-1 infection remains a life-long battle. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cells directed against HIV-1 envelope subunit protein gp120 (HIVCAR T cells) may provide a safe and effective way to eliminate HIV-infected cells.\n\nHowever, the number of HIV-infected cells is low in participants under ART, and CAR T cells disappear if they are not stimulated by their target antigens. Interestingly, about 95% of HIV-1-infected individuals are CMV-seropositive and CMV-specific T cells have been shown to persist. To overcome the CAR T cells low persistence issue, we propose to make HIV-CAR T cells using autologous cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells, which can be stimulated by endogenous CMV in vivo. The overall hypothesis of this first-in-human Phase 1, open-label, single-arm study is that endogenous immune signals to CMV-specific T cells can maintain the presence of autologous bispecific CMV/HIV-CAR T cells in healthy people living with HIV-1 (PLWH), and achieve long-term remission in the presence of ART.",

However, HIV-infected cells in participants under ART, and CAR T cells disappear if they are not stimulated by their target antigens. Interestingly, about 95% of individuals with HIV-1 are CMV-seropositive and CMV-specific T cells have been shown to persist at high frequency due to CMV antigen stimulation. To overcome the CAR T cells low persistence issue, we propose to make HIV-CAR T cells using autologous cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells, which can be stimulated by endogenous CMV in vivo. The overall hypothesis of this first-in-human, open-label, single-arm, pilot study is that endogenous immune signals to CMV-specific T cells can maintain the presence of autologous bispecific CMV/HIV-CAR T cells in healthy people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). Based on the results of this safety study, CMV vaccine and analytic treatment interruption will be evaluated with the CMV/HIV-CAR T cell investigational product in a subsequent protocol.\n\nThe trial is a first-in-human, pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of CMV/HIV-CAR T cells in PLWH. Eligible participants will temporarily interrupt their ART regimen for 4 days prior to leukapheresis to prevent residual cell drug levels that could inhibit lentiviral transduction of the T cells during CAR T cell manufacturing. Participants will resume their ART regimen immediately after leukapheresis. If the manufacturing is not successful, a second apheresis may be scheduled no sooner than 3 weeks later with temporary interruption of ART regimen for 4 days prior to leukapheresis. Participants will resume their ART regimen immediately after leukapheresis. Once the final cell product is released, participants will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of autologous CMV/HIV-CAR T cells (defined as Day 0). Up to three doses of CMV/HIV-CAR T cells may be explored."
