            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if performing a lateral soft tissue release during a Chevron osteotomy (or Akin osteotomy when appropriate) for bunions leads to better correction without added complications in 200 patients over the age of 18 years old with the capacity to consent and mild to moderate bunions that are determined to benefit from Chevron osteotomies by one of the IRB approved study physicians. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nHow does the addition of a lateral soft tissue release (LSTR) in a Chevron osteotomy bunion surgery affect hallux valgus alpha angle (HVA) correction? How does the addition of an LSTR in a Chevron osteotomy bunion surgery affect intermetatarsal angle (IMA) degrees of correction? Researchers will compare Chevron osteotomy bunion surgeries with and without LSTR to see if LSTRs lead to better correction without added complications.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Be randomized to a control group where they receive a typical Chevron osteotomy bunion surgery or to the experimental group where they receive a Chevron osteotomy bunion surgery with an LSTR.\n* Complete surveys preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.\n* Receive routine x-rays pre and postoperatively to compare hallux valgus angle (HVA)."
