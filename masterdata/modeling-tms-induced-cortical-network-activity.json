            "briefSummary": "This is a study of normal brain physiology in healthy human volunteers. The study aims to understand the physiology of connectivity between brain regions. To reach this aim, it delivers single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to one or two brain areas at a time while electroencephalography (EEG) is measured. When only one brain area is stimulated (uni-focal TMS), the goal is to record how many milliseconds it takes for the activity to spread from the stimulated area to other brain regions (conduction delay). When two brain areas are stimulated (bi-focal TMS), the TMS pulses are separated by a short millisecond-level time interval (\"asynchrony\") in a so-called paired associative stimulation (PAS) design. The central hypothesis is that PAS may increase or decrease connectivity between the stimulated areas depending on the asynchrony value. All techniques in the study are non-invasive and considered safe.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goal of the study is to illuminate the physiology of inter-regional connectivity in the human brain. Participants are healthy adult volunteers without disorders or medications influencing brain function (N=80). During uni-focal TMS, only one brain area is stimulated at a time, and the conduction delays and connectivity strengths between the stimulated brain area and other brain regions are quantified with source-resolved EEG. During the bi-focal TMS sessions, a range of negative and positive PAS asynchronies (from minus 50 to + 50 ms relative to the conduction delays) will be tested in separate sessions, and the within-session connectivity changes from PAS are estimated by applying uni-focal TMS before and after PAS. The targeted brain areas include the primary motor cortices in the left and right hemisphere as well as areas outside the primary motor cortices. All techniques included in the study are non-invasive and considered safe: TMS, EEG, electromyography (EMG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and behavioral measures. The TMS parameters in this study are considered safe, as only single or pairs of TMS pulses are delivered."

Thereafter, bi-focal TMS (PAS) will be applied in three separate sessions, each using a different asynchrony. PAS may selectively increase or decrease effective connectivity depending on the asynchrony. Specifically, negative asynchronies (a few milliseconds shorter than the inter-regional conduction delay) are expected to decrease effective connectivity, zero asynchrony (equal to conduction delay) is predicted to have no effect, whereas positive asynchronies (a few milliseconds longer than the inter-regional conduction delay) are expected to increase it.",
