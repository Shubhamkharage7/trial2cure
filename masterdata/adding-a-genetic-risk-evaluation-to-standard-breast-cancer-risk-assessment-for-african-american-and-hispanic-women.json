            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates whether adding a polygenic risk score evaluation to standard breast cancer risk assessment tools helps African American and Hispanic women make more informed decisions about accepting additional breast cancer screening and prevention strategies. Traditional breast cancer risk assessments rely mostly on the presence of standard clinical risk factors including family history, reproductive history, and mammographic breast density. This information can be combined with validated risk estimation models to provide a measure of a patient's 10 year and lifetime risk for breast cancer. A polygenic risk score helps to estimate breast cancer risk in a more individualized way by evaluating a patient's genetics. Adding a polygenic risk score evaluation to traditional screening techniques may help minority women make more informed decisions about screening and prevention strategies for breast cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore if the addition of an individual polygenic risk score (PRS) to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) or Tyrer-Cuzick (IBIS) score will improve intentions to adhere to recommended breast cancer screening strategies such as mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or molecular breast Imaging in women of underserved racial minorities.\n\nII. To explore if the addition of the PRS to the BCRAT or IBIS risk score will aid women in deciding whether to take preventative endocrine therapy in women of racial minorities.\n\nIII. To understand how individualized risk assessment and information on PRS may alter perceived risk of breast cancer.\n\nIV. To follow this cohort of women over 10 years to determine subsequent outcomes in regards to diagnoses of at-risk lesions or cancer.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients complete a survey and undergo collection of a blood sample for PRS genotyping at baseline. Patients receive their PRS results and complete another survey 6 weeks to 6 months after baseline and then complete surveys annually over 10 years on study."
