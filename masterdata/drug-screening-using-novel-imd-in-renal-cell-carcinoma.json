            "detailedDescription": "This Pilot research is being done to study the safety and feasibility of implanting and retrieving a microdevice that releases microdoses of 19 specific drugs or drug combinations as a possible tool to evaluate the effectiveness of several cancer drugs against metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The drugs participants receive will include medications currently used as standard-of-care treatment for metastatic RCC as well as medications currently approved in other cancer types that are under investigation for treatment of RCC.\n\n* This study involves planting 1 to 6 microdevices, each small enough to fit inside the tip of a needle, into a tumor. The microdevices will release microdoses of cancer drugs via passive diffusion. The drugs will only penetrate the local tumor tissues.\n* After approximately 3 days, the microdevices and small regions of surrounding tissues will be removed and analyzed.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study imaging and evaluations, blood collections, tumor biopsies, and follow up visits.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the microdevice as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe drugs being used have been FDA-approved for the treatment of cancers.\n\nParticipation in this research study is expected to last up to 4 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 5 people will take part in this research study."
