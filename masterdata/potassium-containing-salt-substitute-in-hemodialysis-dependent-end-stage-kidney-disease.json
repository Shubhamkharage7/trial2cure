There will be a 19 day wash out period between the salt-substitute and table salt periods. Potassium concentration will be measured bi-weekly prior to HD each week during intervention. The primary endpoint will be the change in potassium from baseline. Additional measurements will include assessment of dietary intake, ambulatory blood pressure, occurrence of peri-dialytic symptoms, and per-dialytic vital signs."
