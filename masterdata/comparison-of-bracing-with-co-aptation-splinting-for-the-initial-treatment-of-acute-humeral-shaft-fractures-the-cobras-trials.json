The two methods of initial management for humeral shaft fractures are sarmiento bracing (pre-fabricated fracture brace) and coaptation splinting. In this study, the team will compare patient related outcomes and comfort for each method of initial management of humeral shaft fractures. Participant pain, narcotic usage, and function will be tracked over a 2 week period to see which method of immobilization is preferred."
