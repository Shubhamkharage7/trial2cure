Another drug will be used in this study called \"QS-21\". It is not intended to treat any disease but is used in this study to improve the action of the study drug TG01.\n\nQS-21 has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be mixed with a vaccine used to prevent shingles. It has not been approved to be mixed with the study drug, TG01.\n\nParticipants will undergo eligibility screening, weekly visits during treatment when receiving the study drug or study drug combination, two safety follow-up visits, at about 30 and 90 days after the last dose of study treatment, and long term follow up for about 12 months after the last dose of study treatment."
