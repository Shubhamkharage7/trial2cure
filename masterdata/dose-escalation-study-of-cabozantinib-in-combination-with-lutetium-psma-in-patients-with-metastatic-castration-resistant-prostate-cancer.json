The primary hypothesis is that cabozantinib with 177Lu-PSMA will be safe and have efficacy in patients with mCRPC. The dose-escalation phase (Part 1) will assess the rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation period and identify the MTD and/or recommended dose and schedule for the subsequent expansion phase (Part 2)."
