            "briefSummary": "This research study is comparing the use of a new form of hormonal therapy used with radiation as a possible treatment for intermediate risk prostate cancer. More specifically, this research would help determine whether this new form of hormonal therapy is as effective as the standard hormone therapy while also preserving erectile function.",
            "detailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking at whether the novel form of hormonal therapy, called Darolutamide, when paired with radiation therapy will provide the same quality of care as the current standard treatments available for men with this type of cancer. Darolutamide prevents testosterone from signaling throughout the body. Although studies have shown that Darolutamide has activity in more advanced forms of prostate cancer, the activity of Darolutamide is unknown in intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Darolutamide as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe current standard of care treatments available to men with this type of cancer are radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) involving a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist plus bicalutamide (both FDA-approved) or surgery. ADT works by depriving the body of testosterone which \"feeds\" prostate cancer cells and weakens prostate cancer cells from repairing damage caused by radiation therapy.\n\nIn addition, the investigator will be assessing erectile function at baseline, during and after treatment to determine if short-term erectile function can be preserved without sacrificing long-term disease control."

Patients with lymph nodes greater than 1.5 cm on short axis will require a negative biopsy for eligibility.\n* Metastatic disease, as assessed by abdominal or pelvic computed tomography (CT) or other imaging modality. Patients with 3 intermediate risk factors will require a CT abdomen/pelvis and a bone scan or PET imaging (PSMA PET/CT, fluciclovine PET/CT, etc.).\n* Erectile aids other than oral phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors\n* History of any of the following: Severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, arterial or venous thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks), clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B or C), viral hepatitis, or human immunodeficiency virus within 6 months prior to randomization.\n* Current untreated hypertension (systolic \\>= 160 mmHg or diastolic \\>= 100 mmHg). Patients with one blood pressure reading with systolic \\< 160 mmHg and diastolic \\< 100 mmHg within 90 days of registration would be eligible for study.\n* Individuals with a history of another malignancy are not eligible if:\n\n  * The cancer is under active treatment\n  * The cancer can be seen on radiology scans\n  * If they are off cancer treatment, but in the opinion of their oncologist, have a high risk of relapse within 5 years.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to study drugs\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 Grade 2), psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would preclude participation in this study",
