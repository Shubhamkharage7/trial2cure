The primary outcome will be restricted to inpatients. However, outpatients will be simultaneously enrolled given the trial's cluster design. Sample-size is based on our primary inpatient analysis, N= 66,273 inpatients. Available outpatients will be included for analysis of our secondary outcome which includes both inpatients and outpatients."
