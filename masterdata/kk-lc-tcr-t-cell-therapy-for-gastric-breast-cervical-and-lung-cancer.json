            "detailedDescription": "This study will determine the MTD of KK-LC-1 TCR-T cells for the treatment of metastatic cancers that express KK-LC-1 and will assess clinical tumor response to treatment. KK-LC-1 is an abnormal protein that is expressed by certain types of cancer. The cancers that most commonly express KK-LC-1 include gastric, lung, breast, and cervix cancer. KK-LC-1 TCR-T cells are autologous T cells that are genetically engineered to target the KK-LC-1 antigen. Tumor targeting by the KK-LC-1 TCR requires that subjects have the the HLA-A\\*01:01 allele. Participants will receive a conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. They will then receive a single infusion of KK-LC-1 TCR-T cells, which will be followed by administration of aldesleukin. Adverse events, dose limiting toxicity, tumor response, and tumor response duration will be determined."

Current treatment with another investigational agent.\n2. History of severe allergic reactions to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents in used in study.\n3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations at the time of treatment that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n4. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with KK-LC-1 TCR T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with KK-LC-1 TCR cells. The potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n5. Participants with a systemic immunodeficiency including acquired deficiency such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the treatment.\n6. Participants on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids unless meeting criteria outlined in Section 6.1 (Prohibited Medications).\n7. Subjects with HLA-A\\*01:01 damaging mutation or allele loss or other molecular resistance detected by clinical or research genomic profiling will not be eligible.\n8. Participants with potentially severe autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus are not eligible. Patients with less severe autoimmune diseases such as hypothyroidism, vitiligo, and other minor autoimmune disorders are eligible.\n9. Participants with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment is unlikely to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessments of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n   1. Carcinoma in situ\n   2. Cutaneous skin cancers requiring only local excision\n   3. Low grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer\n   4. Low grade prostate cancer Participants with prior or concurrent malignancy that do not meet the above criteria are excluded.\n10. Subjects who received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment are not eligible.\n11.
