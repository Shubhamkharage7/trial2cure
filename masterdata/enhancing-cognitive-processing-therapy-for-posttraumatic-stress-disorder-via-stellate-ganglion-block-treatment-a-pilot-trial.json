            "briefSummary": "Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an effective first-line, evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite its well-demonstrated effectiveness, research has shown that approximately two-thirds of individuals continue to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD even after successful treatment completion. Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) treatment, involving a local anesthesia injection to the stellate ganglion (around the lower base of the neck), has been shown to block its pain signal transmissions. Prior case studies and reviews have provided evidence for reducing PTSD symptoms with SGB treatment. However, studies to date have only examined SGB as a standalone intervention. The utility of combining CPT with concurrent SGB treatment remains unknown, although it is plausible that the combination of the two treatments can improve the effectiveness of CPT alone. The present study aims to test this hypothesis by comparing either a combined 1-week massed CPT + SGB treatment and 1-week massed CPT + placebo treatment (saline injection) using a randomized controlled trial design."
