The goal of the study is to determine the optimal dose of sacituzumab govitecan for use in combination with cisplatin for treatment of epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, Phase 1 study with a dose expansion cohort, conducted in two separate disease groups (ovarian and endometrial cancer). The primary objective of the study is to determine the optimal dose of sacituzumab govitecan for use in combination with cisplatin for treatment of epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers.\n\nFor each disease group, there will be a safety run-in phase utilizing a 3+3 design with a de-escalated dose level if the starting dose shows toxicity and an expansion cohort to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and tolerability of the experimental regimen. The dose expansion cohort will consist of 14 patients in the ovarian cohort and 12 patients in the endometrial cohort with an additional 2 patients in each cohort to account for potential patient replacement. This will yield a total sample size of 22-28 patients in the ovarian cancer cohort and a total sample size of 20-26 patients in the endometrial cancer cohort.\n\nPhase 1, Safety Run-in with Dose De-escalation Scheme:\n\nDose Level 0, starting level: Sacituzumab govitecan 10 mg/kg + Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV Dose -1: Sacituzumab govitecan 7.5 mg/kg + Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV In this stage, a minimum of 6 patients and a maximum of 12 patients will be required.\n\nThe recommended dose expansion cohort (DEC) dose is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 patients experience a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)\n\nPhase 2, Dose Expansion Cohort:\n\nSacituzumab govitecan 7.5-10 mg/kg IV (depending on phase I result) + Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV.\n\nDrug product administration will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or death.\n\nThe DEC is designed to indicate proof of concept regarding the overall response rate (ORR) and safety of the combination of sacituzumab with cisplatin at the dose established in the safety run-in phase of the study. Once the recommended DEC dose for sacituzumab and cisplatin combination has been established for each disease cohort, an additional 14 patients will be enrolled for the ovarian group and and 12 patients for the endometrial group. An additional 2 patients will be added to each cohort to account for potential patient replacement for a total of 42-54 evaluable patients."
