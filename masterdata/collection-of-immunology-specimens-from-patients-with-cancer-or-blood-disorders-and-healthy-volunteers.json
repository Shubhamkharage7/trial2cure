            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. Identify changes in immune system parameters in patients receiving immunotherapies (including immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunostimulatory/immunomodulatory agents, cellular therapies, stem cell transplantation) and compare to changes in patients receiving conventional chemotherapy, targeted-agent therapy, and healthy normal volunteers using multiparameter flow cytometry, time-of-flight mass cytometry, cytokine quantification, functional analysis of immune cell subsets isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and genetic and proteomic techniques (deoxyribonucleic acid \\[DNA\\] sequencing, ribonucleic acid sequence \\[RNASeq\\], reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction \\[RT-PCR\\], Western blot).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Optimize methods for measuring functional status of circulating immune cells and hematopoietic progenitors (activation, inhibition, cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity).\n\nII. Use genetic and epigenetic techniques to a) study clonal diversity in T cell subsets b) determine the genetic basis for T cell immune reconstitution following stem cell transplantation.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients and healthy normal volunteers undergo collection of peripheral blood samples for analysis via flow cytometry, RNASeq, immunohistochemistry, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) experiments, cell cultures, and functional studies of immune cell subsets obtained by FACS. Patients also undergo collection of bone marrow and leukopheresis/leukoreduction specimens, and single cell suspensions and bulk excised tumor biopsies are obtained from routine testing for analysis via immunohistochemistry or CyTOF.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 2 years."
