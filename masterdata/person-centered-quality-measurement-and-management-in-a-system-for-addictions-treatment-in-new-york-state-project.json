            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to implement Opioid Use Disorder Quality Measurement and Management (OUD-QM2) strategy by the Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) to drive change and improve treatment practices. Through a concurrent mixed methods approach that iteratively examines quantitative and qualitative data to inform the process, the investigators will examine the effects of the strategy on stakeholders-PWUD/patients, families, and providers-and outcomes. This comprehensive approach will allow for a \"global\" view of the perceived effects of the OUD-QM2 strategy for all stakeholders while allowing us to use administrative data to test the effects of the strategy on patient outcomes. Through qualitative interviews and focus groups conducted in years 1, 3, and 5 of the phase, the investigators will derive information from stakeholders about their perceptions and use of the quality measures. Through surveys conducted with all clinics, the investigators will elicit data on changes in provider use of quality measures, clinical practice, and use of measures for incentive-based contracting. Finally, the investigators will conduct a stepped wedge trial to examine the effects of performance coaching that guides clinics on use of the quality measures for clinical practice improvement. The trial will also benefit from a treatment as usual (TAU) condition of clinics not participating in the trial to examine secular trends in patient outcomes across the period of the OASAS QM2 strategy rollout. The overall aim is to build and test a science-based OUD-QM2 strategy for person-centered treatment."
