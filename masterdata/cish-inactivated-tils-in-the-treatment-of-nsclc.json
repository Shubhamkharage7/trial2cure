            "detailedDescription": "Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) have shown efficacy in certain cancers, principally in melanoma, but also in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Combination cell surface checkpoint inhibitor therapy has also been employed in an attempt to enhance the efficacy of these cell therapies. Genetic engineering of T cells to further increase anti-tumor activity is now possible.\n\nCISH (Cytokine-induced SH2 protein) is a novel intra-cellular immune checkpoint and an important negative regulator of T-cell signaling and function. The inhibition of CISH in mouse anti-tumor lymphocytes results in a marked increase in the ability of these lymphocytes to mediate tumor regression following administration to tumor bearing mice.\n\nAdditionally, data in genetically-engineered, neoantigen-specific human T cells in which CISH was inhibited, showed enhanced TCR functional avidity and increased ability of these T cells to detect cancer specific mutations and mount robust polyfunctional cytokine immune responses against their cognate cancer antigens. Thus, these T cells appear to have a significant advantage in inducing anti-tumor responses compared to wild-type anti-tumor lymphocytes.\n\nThe researchers have developed and optimized a CRISPR/Cas9 based strategy for precise and efficient genetic engineering in primary human T-cells without sacrificing cell viability or function, allowing for inhibition of a heretofore undruggable intracellular checkpoint.\n\nThus, in this protocol, the researchers propose to inhibit the gene encoding the intracellular checkpoint target CISH in TIL from patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are PD-L1 negative or positive in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of genetically engineered T cell therapy in the setting of novel checkpoint inhibition ."

The tumor resection for investigational product manufacturing should be undertaken before the initiation of this 1st line therapy; however, patients who have already started their 1st line treatment should have these procedures performed and completed as soon as deemed clinically appropriate, but no later than 6 months (Phase 1) or 3 months (Phase 2) from the start of 1st line treatment. After documented radiographic disease progression on or following this 1st line of treatment, patients will receive investigational product as 2nd line therapy.\n* Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 with at least one lesion identified as resectable for cell therapy manufacturing (minimum volume of tumor tissue required is 1 cm\\^2 as single mass or fragments) and at least one other lesion meeting the RECIST criteria for measurable disease to serve as an indicator of disease response. The location of the tumor resection and method used to obtain tumor (i.e., laparoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, etc.) will be determined based on an individual patient's disease. Note: previously irradiated lesions with radiographic progression are not eligible for tumor resection.\n* Patients who have asymptomatic and or treated brain metastases are eligible, but must be discussed with and approved by the Coordinating Investigator. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible. Patients with brain metastases must not be receiving systemic steroids (oral progestin/estrogen combinations used for contraception are an exception).

(The investigational treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immunocompetence and thus may be less responsive to the study treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)\n  * Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.\n* Sexually active females of childbearing potential and males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception for the duration of study treatment starting with Screening and for 12 months (females) and 4 months (males) after the last dose of cyclophosphamide; if receiving pembrolizumab, for 4 months (females and males) after the last dose of pembrolizumab.
