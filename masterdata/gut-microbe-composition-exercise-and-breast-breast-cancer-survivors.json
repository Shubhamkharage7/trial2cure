Through careful design, this study will use a controlled-feeding diet and 10 weeks of exercise training to determine exercise effects on the number, distribution, and types of bacteria in the gut of breast cancer survivors. These changes will then be linked to fatigue and physiologic effects of exercise to determine how the information can be used to enhance exercise benefits and identify new treatment strategies leveraging changes in gut bacteria communities."
