            "briefSummary": "Women at risk for development of breast cancer and experiencing vasomotor menopausal symptoms (hot flashes) will be randomized to bazedoxifene (BZA) plus conjugated estrogens (CE) for 6 months versus a wait list control. Two risk factors for development of breast cancer will be studied pre-study and after 6 months: fibroglandular volume (FGV) on mammogram as assessed by Volpara software and proliferation by Ki-67 immunocytochemistry in benign breast tissue acquired by random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA). Change in biomarkers will be compared between groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "Phase IIB trial of 6 months of BZA 20 mg +CE 0.45 mg (subsequently designated as BZA+CE) vs a waitlist control. Trial is informed by prior results of a single arm trial that used Duavee\u00ae (combination of BZA+CE that is FDA-approved for relief of hot flashes). Since Duavee\u00ae is currently not available commercially, the two separate components are used instead. Breast imaging, benign breast tissue by RPFNA, and blood for biomarkers will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months using similar assessment techniques. The primary endpoint is the difference between the BZA+CE and control groups for absolute change from baseline to 6 months in the risk biomarker fibroglandular volume (FGV). Volpara\u00ae fully automated assessments overcome the interpretive variance inherent in subjective assessments. Additional endpoints include changes in benign breast epithelial immunolabeling for Ki-67, estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), progesterone receptor (PR), and anterior gradient-2 protein (AGR2); and systemic levels of bioavailable hormones, IGF-1, IGFBP3, and measures of insulin sensitivity. The modifying effects of baseline BMI, visceral adipose, and plasma BZA concentrations on markers will be studied."

Women whose breast size require mosaic views will not be eligible.\n* Clinical mammogram Interpretation: Mammograms read out as Class 0 or IV must be resolved with additional procedures prior to randomization or entry on intervention phase. Women having a recent benign biopsy subsequent to a BIRADS IV mammogram with continuing BIRADs IV on baseline mammogram for Volpara assessment may be entered if other clinical assessments (i.e., MRI) is judged as not worrisome for cancer and/or re-biopsy or re-excision is not being considered by the patient's clinical team.\n* Raw data DICOM files must be available for generation of Volpara Score Card. Study consent must be signed prior to sending the DICOM files to the researcher server as these files will contain patient identifiers.\n* A Volpara score card must be generated for at least 1 breast and the FGV must meet minimal requirements for BMI.\n* If BMI \\< 25 kg/m2, then FGV must average at least 20 cm3 per breast (i.e., \u226520 cm3 if only one breast evaluable and \u226540 cm3 total if both breasts evaluable).\n* If BMI is 25-38 kg/m2 then FGV must be at least 30 cm3 per breast (i.e., \u226530 cm3 if only one breast evaluable and \u226560 cm3 total if both breasts evaluable).\n* The Volpara\u00ae \"Score Card\" must be sent to KUMC prior to randomization.\n\nRPFNA must be performed and specimen received at KUMC in good condition. RPFNA specimen must have ductal/lobular epithelial cells on Thinprep\u00ae slides; but there is no requirement for a specific cell number, value for Ki-67, or cytomorphology.\n\nBlood must be drawn prior to randomization and sent to KUMC.\n\nComplete Menopause specific quality of life questionnaire, information for hot flash score.\n\nWilling to comply with study procedures.\n\nParticipants at KUMC: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA)\n\nPregnancy test for women \\<age 55 with intact uterus\n\nExclusion Criteria for Randomization Intercurrent illness which makes potential participant unsuitable for study; Starting hormone replacement therapy (prescription pills, injections, patches) between mammogram/RPFNA and enrollment on study.",
