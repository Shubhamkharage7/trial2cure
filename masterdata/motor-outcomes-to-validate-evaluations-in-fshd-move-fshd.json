By collecting measures specific to FSHD, this will help ensure the best level of clinical care is being provided. Also, the hope is to speed up drug development by gaining a better understanding of how having FSHD impacts motor function and other health outcomes (i.e. breathing, wheelchair use, etc.) and how big a change in motor function would be clinically meaningful to those with FSHD.\n\nMotor Outcomes to Validate Evaluations in FSHD (MOVE FSHD) will have approximately 450 FSHD participants followed for a minimum of 3 years. A subset of MOVE FSHD participants, approximately 200, will participate in the MOVE+ sub-study which includes whole body MRI and muscle biopsy."
