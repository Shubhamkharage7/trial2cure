Absolute lymphocyte will be obtained along with changes in levels of NK cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells from baseline.\n2. Monitor the safety of NKTR-255, which includes treatment related grade 3+ radiation pneumonitis\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. Estimate the Progression-free survival time distribution\n2. Estimate the Overall survival time distribution\n\nExploratory objectives:\n\n1. Characterize pharmacokinetics of NKTR-255 and assess immunogenicity of NKTR-255\n2. Characterize pharmacodynamic effects and changes in activation markers and proliferation of NK and CD8 T cells, and cytokine levels after administration of NKTR-255 in combination with Durvalumab\n3. Assess the correlation between ctDNA and efficacy measurements"

Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational product\n6. Recurrent radiation to the treatment site\n7.

Other condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, compromises the subject's welfare or may confound study results\n9. Previous enrollment in this study\n10. Pregnancy: a female subject defined as a WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test (e.g. within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n11. Prior exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody.\n12. Patients must be capable of understanding and providing a written informed consent.\n13. Patients with leukemias or lymphomas with T cell/histiocyte or NK cell rich component(s) and other variants not otherwise specified that contain high numbers of T or NK cells.\n14. Evidence of clinically significant interstitial lung disease or active noninfectious pneumonitis during the course of chemoradiation that is unresolved to \u2264 grade 1.\n15. Patients with grade 4 toxicities during chemoradiation not resolved to grade \u2264 1 by the end of chemoradiation.\n16. Prior exposure to IL-2 or IL-5.",
