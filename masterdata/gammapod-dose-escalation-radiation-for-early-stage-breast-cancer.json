            "briefSummary": "The GammaPod machine was made by Xcision Medical Systems and is already FDA cleared to deliver focused radiation within the breast. Unlike current radiation machines, the GammaPod was designed specifically for treating breast cancer. The GammaPod can pinpoint radiation to the tumor bed in the breast which lowers the amount of radiation to nearby tissues. The machine uses a breast cup system to hold the breast in place for the treatment. This breast cup system was tested at MSGCCC (Marlene Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center). Patients reported this system was more comfortable than an MRI or mammogram. The cup system was able to securely position the breast for treatment in the correct location.\n\nReceiving radiation before surgery is not a new concept in cancer management. Preoperative radiation has proven to result in improved disease free survival in certain types of cancer.\n\nWith this study treatment, the participants will receive a dose of breast radiation therapy before the lumpectomy surgery. The lumpectomy surgery is where they remove the participant's tumor.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to determine a safe and effective dose of pre-operative radiation to treat early stage breast cancer. The pre-operative radiation is delivered using the FDA approved, GammaPod machine. The study will also determine the cosmesis of pre-operative radiation at different doses. Cosmesis is another word for looking at skin changes. The research team will use questionnaires for patient and physicians to assess adverse cosmesis changes as accurately as possible. In addition, the investigators are going to assess radiation related changes using photo software analysis tools and patients quality of life."

MR imaging measurements can be included only if performed BEFORE the biopsy (postbiopsy measurements can be larger as a result of hematoma formation or increased edema).\n* Tumor must be unifocal.\n* Patients must be \\> 45 years old.\n* The tumor must be visible on a CT scan.\n* Patients must undergo MR imaging for work-up to aid in tumor delineation and to rule out additional foci of disease. If additional foci of disease are found to be present, then these must be biopsied with negative results to proceed with treatment.\n* The tumor must be clinically and radiographically N0 (node negative). If a suspicious node is visualized, it must be biopsied with negative results.\n* Patients must be estrogen-receptor positive.\n* Patients must be HER2neu negative.\n* Patients must weigh \\<150 kg (330 lb), which is the limit of the imaging loader.\n* Patients must be \\<6'6\" in height, again because of instrumentation limitations.\n* Patients must be able to lie prone for treatment.\n* Patients must have no lymphovascular invasion on biopsy.\n* Patients may be taking hormonal therapy prior to initiation of treatment.
