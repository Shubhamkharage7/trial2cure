Dose escalation will be guided by the modified toxicity probability interval-2 (mTPI-2) design with a target toxicity rate of 25% and an acceptable DLT interval of 20% to 30%. Cohorts of 2 or more patients will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels of PEEL-224. For each dose level, all patients must complete Cycle 1 before the decision to dose escalate the next cohort of patients is made."
