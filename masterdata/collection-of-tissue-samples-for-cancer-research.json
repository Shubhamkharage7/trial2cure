Non-surgical procedures, such as percutaneous biopsies, may also be performed for the sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or biological fluids for this protocol. Tissues and biological fluids to be procured may include but are not limited to blood, serum, urine, tumor tissue, normal tissue, pleural fluid, CSF, saliva, bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL), circulating tumor cells, hair follicles, and bone marrow. These specimens will be stored with unique identifiers and used to perform only those research studies that are outlined in this protocol.\n* For pediatric patients: tumor biopsy/resection tissue used for pediatric preclinical model development will only be from tissue already being obtained as part of a procedure necessary for the patient s clinical care or as part of a primary research protocol; blood specimens will be collected as part of a blood collection already scheduled for the patient s clinical care or as part of the planned pre-procedure bloodwork; volumes collected will not exceed institutional research limits.\n* Given the risks associated with any invasive procedure, such as tumor biopsy, the procedure will be discussed in detail with the patients and their parents/guardian (as indicated), including the side effects, prior to obtaining a separate consent for each procedure. A separate consent will not be signed prior to obtaining samples by minimally invasive measures, such as venipuncture.\n* This study has two separate consent forms at the NIH Clinical Center: one for adult patients to donate specimens for ongoing research on assay development and studies of molecular pathways, and one for adult and age-appropriate pediatric patients to donate samples for the generation of preclinical models. The study also has consent form templates for adult and pediatric patients at participating sites to donate specimens to create preclinical models.\n* Patients may remain on study for the duration of their consent or completion of the planned procedure, whichever comes first.",
