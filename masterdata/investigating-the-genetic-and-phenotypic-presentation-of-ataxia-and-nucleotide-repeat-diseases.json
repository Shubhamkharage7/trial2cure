The analysis will be conducted to provide better clinical, genetic, and pathological characterizations of neurodegenerative forms of spinocerebellar ataxia. The investigators would like to create a repository for samples on these cases as well as prospective cases who are seen via clinic, support groups, referrals etc. The investigators will perform clinical evaluations utilizing ataxia pertinent scales. The investigators project to expand the present genealogical bank by collecting more specimens and identify more families in the process. All this will be performed in collaboration with basic scientists in order to conduct proper laboratory investigation that will help arrive at a cure for neurodegenerative forms of spinocerebellar ataxia and nucleotide repeat diseases excluding Huntington's Disease ."
