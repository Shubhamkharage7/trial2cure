            "briefSummary": "This study seeks to understand if the medication pramipexole improves social connectedness and functioning in adults (ages 18-50) who experience anxiety or depression. The study plans to enroll 108 participants total across two sites (University of California San Diego and New York State Psychiatric Institute). Pramipexole will be given in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Social reward processing will be assessed using measures of brain function (fMRI), behavior, and self-report at baseline and week 6. Knowledge gained from this study will help determine the therapeutic potential of targeting the dopamine system to remediate social disconnection as an anxiety and depression intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study seeks to understand how modulating functioning of the neurotransmitter dopamine affects brain circuits, behaviors, and subjective experiences that are believed to underlie an individual's motivation to establish and maintain positive social connections. This knowledge will help advance understanding of brain mechanisms that can be used to better treat social functioning impairments in people experiencing anxiety or depression. The R61 phase project will evaluate the effects of pramipexole (a medication that increases dopamine signaling in the brain) on responses to different types of positive social cues or contexts. The study drug will be given in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for individuals with clinical levels of anxiety or depression.\n\nAim 1 will test the hypothesis that pramipexole increases the anticipation of social rewards compared to placebo. Aim 2 will determine which dose of pramipexole (1.0 or 2.5 mg/d) produces a greater effect on social reward anticipation. To achieve these aims, approximately 108 participants (ages 18-50) with clinically elevated anxiety or depression will be randomized across two sites and randomized in equal proportions to one of two doses of pramipexole (1.0 mg/d or 2.5 mg/d) or placebo. They will complete standardized paradigms assessing social reward processing using measures of brain function (fMRI), behavior, and self-report at baseline and week 6. Knowledge gained from this study will help determine the therapeutic potential of targeting the dopamine system to remediate social disconnection."

History of bipolar or psychotic disorders.\n3. History of major neurological disorder or moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.\n4. History of severe or unstable medical conditions that might be compromised by participation in the study (e.g., cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurologic or hematologic disease; history of seizure disorder).\n5. Past 6-month substance use disorder (any severity) with the exception of mild alcohol, cannabis, or tobacco use disorder, which will be permitted in the study.\n6.

Anticipated inability to attend regular study appointments.\n16. Anticipated inability to complete the study procedures as determined by study personnel.\n17. Clinical conditions assessed by the interviewer that necessitate more imminent clinical care. These criteria are in place so participants with these other, more severe symptoms can be referred for appropriate services (e.g. self-injurious behavior or exposure to a severe traumatic event in the past week).\n18. Non-correctable vision or hearing problems, as some tests require intact sensory functioning.\n19. No telephone or easy access to telephone.\n20. MRI contraindications\n21. CGI-S score of 6 or 7.",
