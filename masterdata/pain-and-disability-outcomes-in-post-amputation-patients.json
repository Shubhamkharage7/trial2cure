The primary outcome will be assessment of pain severity at rest and with movement as measured by pain scores on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10, where 0 is not pain and 10 is the worst pain possible, taken on post-operative day 1, day 7, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year (+/- 3 days at each time point).",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of varied medical and procedural therapies used to treat pain for surgical amputation of a limb.\n\nAt present there are number of different type of therapies are performed in the patients who is going through an amputation of any limb for management of their pain adequately such as peripheral nerve block, epidurals, peripheral nerve stimulators etc. However, the effects of these different procedures performed at different time intervals have not been evaluated for their effects on phantom pain and somatic pain long term after the procedures in these group of patients.\n\nWe will be collecting the following data from these patients to see if there is any particular intervention done at particular time of the procedure ( before the amputation vs. after the amputation) affect the long term outcome of these patients such as development of Phantom pain, or chronic pain\n\nThe primary outcome will be assessment of pain severity at rest and with movement as measured by pain scores on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10, where 0 is not pain and 10 is the worst pain possible, taken on postoperative day 1, day 7, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year (+/- 3 days at each time point).\n\nThe secondary outcomes will be 1) phantom limb pain severity as rated on NRS 2) Residual limb (stump) pain as rated on NRS 3) phantom limb sensations 4) Pain Disability Index scores 5) Morphine milligram equivalents. These secondary outcomes will be assessed at the same intervals as the primary outcome.\n\nThis study will help us to find out if there is any utility of any of these procedures performed at particular time of the procedure helps them more than the others for development of somatic or phantom pain."
