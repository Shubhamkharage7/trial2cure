Estimate the standard deviation of phantom limb pain score at baseline and post-treatment (Day 0), Days 1 and 2; Weeks 1, 2, 3, and Months 1, 2 and 3. The investigators will consider using the upper limit of the 75% confidence interval to plan the sample size of future larger trial.\n\nHypothesis 1: Preoperative cryoneurolysis reduces phantom limb pain over 3 month after surgical leg amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: To determine if preoperative cryoneurolysis improves mobility after lower limb amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nHypothesis 1: Preoperative cryoneurolysis improves mobilization (as measured with accelerometer) over 3 the month after surgical leg amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nSecondary Aim 2: To determine if preoperative cryoneurolysis improves general physical and emotional disability after lower limb amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nHypothesis 2: Preoperative cryoneurolysis reduces general physical and emotional disability (as measured with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment) over the 3 month after surgical leg amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nSecondary Aim 3: To determine if preoperative cryoneurolysis decreases opioid use after lower limb amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nHypothesis 3: Preoperative cryoneurolysis reduces opioid consumption over the 3 month after surgical leg amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis.\n\nExploratory Aims:\n\nHypothesis 1: Preoperative cryoneurolysis reduces residual limb pain over the 3 months after surgical leg amputation compared with no cryoneurolysis."
