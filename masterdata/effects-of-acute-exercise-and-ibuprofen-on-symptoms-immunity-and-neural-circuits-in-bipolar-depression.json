Participants will complete four experimental sessions, two with an exercise challenge and two with a resting control condition in a counterbalanced order. Participants will receive either 800mg of ibuprofen or placebo before exercise or rest in order to test whether blocking the inflammatory response to exercise interferes with the neural and psychological effects of exercise."
