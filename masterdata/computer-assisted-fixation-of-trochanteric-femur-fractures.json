            "detailedDescription": "This will be a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial with two treatment cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of patients with closed peritrochanteric femur fractures who undergo open reduction internal fixation with a Stryker\u00a9 Gamma\u2122 cephalomedullary nail using traditional fluoroscopy for insertion of the lag screw. Cohort 2 will consist of patients with closed peritrochanteric femur fractures who undergo open reduction internal fixation with a Stryker\u00a9 Gamma\u2122 cephalomedullary nail using the Stryker\u00a9 ADAPT\u2122 platform to assist with insertion of the lag screw. Patients will be blinded to treatment group allocation as will clinicians/researchers during data processing and analysis.\n\nThe primary outcome will be tip-apex distance, as measured on anteroposterior and lateral hip radiographs. Secondary outcomes will be position of the lag screw as described by Cleveland et al, operative time, fluoroscopy time, and number of Kirschner wire passes prior to final placement of the lag screw. Additionally, evidence of lag screw cutout on hip radiographs, hip range of motion relative to the contralateral hip, overall mobility, social dependency, and pain level will be assessed at 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow up visits."
