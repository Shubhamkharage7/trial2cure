            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cord blood-derived expanded allogeneic natural killer cells (donor natural killer \\[NK\\] cells) and how well they work when given together with cyclophosphamide and etoposide in treating children and young adults with solid tumors that have come back (relapsed) or that do not respond to treatment (refractory). NK cells, white blood cells important to the immune system, are donated/collected from cord blood collected at birth from healthy babies and grown in the lab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving NK cells together with cyclophosphamide and etoposide may work better in treating children and young adults with solid tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of cord blood-derived expanded allogeneic natural killer cells (expanded allogeneic cord donor natural killer \\[NK\\] cells) following chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the persistence of adoptively-transferred cord NK cells after solid tumor directed chemotherapy.\n\nII. Preliminarily define the antitumor activity to adoptively transferred NK cells following the study preparative regimen in the confines of a phase I study.\n\nIII. Determine the immunophenotype and function of the infused NK cell product. IV. Preliminarily evaluate for any correlate of phenotype, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (kir) haplotype, and function with overall response.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cord blood derived allogeneic NK cells.\n\nPatients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 30 minutes and etoposide IV QD over 60 minutes on days 1-5 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive cord blood derived allogeneic NK cells IV on day 8.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 days, and then every week for 30 days."
