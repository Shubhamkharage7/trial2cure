            "briefSummary": "Psoriasis patients are very poorly adherent to topical treatment. If adherence issues are ignored, poor adherence may limit the real-world efficacy of deucravacitinib, too. Forty psoriasis patients recruited from Wake Forest Baptist Health Dermatology Clinic will be enrolled. Twenty will be randomized to a reporting intervention designed to promote better adherence and the remaining 20 patients will serve as controls who will not receive a reporting intervention. Through qualitative interviews of the 40 patients recruited, we plan to study the behaviors of the most adherent patients to better understand specific beliefs and behaviors of adherent patients and to identify practical, modifiable factors that can improve adherence. We will also compare treatment outcomes and efficacy of deucravacitinib between the most and least adherence patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\n\n* PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the proposed study is to identify adherence outliers (high and low adherence), specific beliefs, and behaviors that correspond to better and worse adherence to oral treatment of psoriasis.\n* SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: The investigators will study the efficacy and safety of deucravacitinib in patients who are highly adherent to treatment compared to patients who do not take the medication as directed (including both those who undertreat and overtreat).\n\n  * Safety endpoints will include reported adverse events.\n  * For the characterization of adherence to deucravacitinib, adherence endpoints will include the proportion of subjects with 80% or greater adherence, days with missed treatment, days with overuse, and premature discontinuation."
