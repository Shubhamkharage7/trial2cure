            "detailedDescription": "The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations, a biopsy, and follow up visits.\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved bevacizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nAtezolizumab and bevacizumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells and stop the growth of cancer. Atezolizumab and bevacizumab work by stopping various molecules on cancer cells and body cells from working against the immune system's natural fight against cancer."

Prophylactic use of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (i.e., enoxaparin 40 mg/day) is allowed. However, the use of direct oral anticoagulant therapies such as dabigatran (Pradaxa\u00ae) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto\u00ae) is not recommended due to bleeding risk.\n* History of abdominal or tracheoesophageal fistula, GI perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.\n* Evidence of abdominal free air that is not explained by paracentesis or recent surgical procedure.\n* Serious, non-healing or dehiscing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.\n* Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the study.\n* History of intra-abdominal inflammatory process within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, including, but not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, or colitis.\n* Chronic daily treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab and 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment.",
