Are known to have a structural brain lesion that would interfere either with PET imaging or pathological assessment (e.g. lesions are typically \\> 2 cm at their greatest extent and may include stroke, primary or metastatic neoplasm, other tumors or cystic lesions. Subjects with a history of major stroke or traumatic brain injury or other structural lesion as well as cases with a history of primary Central Nervous System (CNS) neoplasm or known metastatic cancer must be discussed with the study sponsor prior to enrollment)\n3. Have suspected encephalopathy due to alcoholism or end-stage liver disease\n4. Are known to have a Glomerular Filtration Rate below \\< 15 mL/min\n5. Have received an investigational or approved therapy directly targeting amyloid or tau\n6. Are females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, lactating or breastfeeding, or who are not using adequate contraception\n7.
