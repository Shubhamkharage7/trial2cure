            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to better understand the effectiveness and safety of microbiome therapies (MT) as a treatment for patients with Multidrug Resistant Organism (MDRO) colonization after an infection. Limited data from prior studies suggest that MT may be an effective treatment to reduce intestinal MDRO colonization Although shedding of MDROs from patients to their surrounding environment is a recognized pathway of transmission, the potential effect of MT on the transmission of MDRO to other patients in the hospital environment is unclear. This study will test the safety and efficacy of MT for this use in hospitalized patients. This study will also help design larger studies.\n\nThe MT may help reduce MDROs that colonize the gut. By reducing colonization before infections happen, this could help doctors avoid using \"last resort\" antibiotics that can have serious side effects like kidney damage. The reduction in MDROs after MT was originally identified in patients treated with MT for recurrent Clostridioides difficile (often called \"C. diff\") diarrhea. It has been shown that a type of MT called fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) can eliminate both C. difficile and other resistant bacteria.",
            "detailedDescription": "Antimicrobial resistance (AR) has been declared by the World Health Organization to be one of the greatest threats to global health. Every year, at least 2 million people are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and over 23,000 die from such infections.\n\nThis study aims to take initial steps to directly address these public health priorities and clinical threats of MDRO by estimating the safety of the IP in reducing patient-level intestinal MDRO colonization as well as the effect of the IP on environmental contamination. FAIR is a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, clinical trial of the IP for the treatment of MDRO colonization.\n\nThe hypothesis is that lyophilized human intestinal microbiota will safely and efficaciously reduce MDRO colonization. This is a randomized, controlled, clinical trial with two arms: a placebo arm and an intervention arm. The target population will include 40 adult inpatients with multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) colonization after infection. Target MDRO colonization is defined as a positive clinical microbiology bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility result that is consistent with one or more of the following: carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp (VRE), extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter and/or MDR Pseudomonas"
