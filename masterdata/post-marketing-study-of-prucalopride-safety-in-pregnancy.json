The main aim of the study is to learn if any medical problems in pregnant women or their infants might be related to taking prucalopride during pregnancy.\n\nParticipants are not required to take prucalopride during the study. The study is non-interventional. Women and their infants are followed during pregnancy and for 1 year after pregnancy to collect information on maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.\n\nDuring the study, participants will be asked questions during 3 telephone interviews; 2 during pregnancy and 1 just after their expected delivery date. Participants who took or are taking prucalopride will be asked more detailed questions about this during these interviews. All information is collected remotely, and no visits to the study site are required.\n\nAlso, all participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their baby when their baby is about 1 year old."
