            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and the best dose of anti-CD33 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-Cell therapy in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient or donor's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's or donor's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Examine the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering patient-specific donor-derived (allogeneic) CD33-CAR T cells following lymphodepletion in research participants with CD33+ recurrent/refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess activity in the form of CAR T cell expansion and persistence, to assess impact on hematopoiesis, 6-month progression free survival (PFS 6mo) rate, duration of response, and 1-year overall survival (OS) rate.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Change from baseline in numbers of CD33+ blood cells, CD33 expression on leukemia cells and hematopoietic cells.\n\nII. For subjects who receive cetuximab for CAR T cell ablation, assess the activity of infusional cetuximab to eliminate transferred CD33R(CD8h)BBzeta/EGFRt+ T cells.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\nPatients undergo lymphodepletion therapy 3-5 days prior to CAR T cell infusion and receive anti-CD33 CAR T-cells intravenously (IV) on day 0. Patients with persistent CD33+ AML who are \\> 28 days past the initial CAR T infusion, have additional product available and did not experience a dose-limiting toxicity, may optionally receive anti-CD33 CAR T-cells IV."
