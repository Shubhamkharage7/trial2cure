            "detailedDescription": "Black/African American (AA) menthol smokers are disproportionately harmed by tobacco products and could experience significant health benefits from increased availability of well-regulated electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). The current study will evaluate whether ENDS flavor availability affects measures of tobacco use, biomarkers of cigarette/ENDS exposure, and addiction among AA menthol smokers by performing a 3-arm, 6-week clinical trial of ENDS provision with follow-up to 30 days. Results of this work will help FDA make predictions about the impact of moving from the current regulatory market were menthol/tobacco flavored ENDS cartridges are available, to one where only tobacco or unflavored cartridges are available, in order to maximize health-promoting effects and minimize unintended consequences among AA menthol smokers."
