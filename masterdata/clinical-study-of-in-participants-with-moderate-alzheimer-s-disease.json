(Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not be performed during normal treatment of the participant).\n2. Participants must have a reliable study partner/caregiver (per investigator judgement for instance a family member, partner etc., guardian (must be always the same person)) who is in close contact with the patient, available on call and who is able to contribute to the assessment of the ratings of the functional endpoints at specific study visits. This person will be able to communicate in the language in which the participant is being assessed and should also serve as a backup contact for the study site. The study partner/caregiver must sign a separate informed consent form which describes their contributions during the study.\n3. Patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia according to the recommendations from the 2011 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease.\n4.

Patients must have at least 6 years of formal education and fluency in the test language as verbally confirmed by the patient or their legally authorized representative and documented by the study investigator.\n6. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and Visit 1 before first administration of the study drug. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile or who are not post-menopausal (i.e.: no menses for at least 1 year). Male and female participants of reproductive potential must also agree to abstinence or use acceptable form(s) of effective contraception during the study and for 30 days after the final dose of the study drug. Acceptable methods of contraception include the following:\n\n   1. Condoms, sponges, foams, gels, diaphragms, or intrauterine device (IUD).\n   2. Hormonal birth control for 30 days prior to administration of the study drug.\n   3. A vasectomized sexual partner.\n7.

Significant gastrointestinal disorders (for example gastrointestinal bleeding within the last two years, malabsorption syndromes, post-gastrectomy, or active peptic ulcer disease).\n12. Immunological disorder such as per investigator judgement clinically significant allergies, Lupus erythematodes, or scleroderma.\n13. Uncontrolled/Unstable hematological disease (regardless of cause) such as refractory anemia or refractory myelosuppression.\n14. Neurological disease (such as: Lewy body dementia - primary diagnosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's Disease, encephalitis, epilepsy, vascular or multi-infarct dementia, stroke, congenital mental deficiency, multiple sclerosis) and psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, or intellectual disability), or any other disorders impacting cognitive function.\n15. Unstable/uncontrolled major depression or anxiety within the last 12 months.\n16. History of seizures in the past three years.\n17. Uncontrolled endocrine disease such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or manifest hyperthyroidism, in the opinion of the investigator.\n18. Severe renal impairment defined as a GFR \\< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the screening lab report\n19. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or any other infection or active systemic disease.\n20. Currently being treated with anticoagulants (except aspirin at or below a prophylactic dose).\n21. Participants who are taking medications for AD, like memantine or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) that exceeds the normal recommended dose range or have not achieved a stable dose for the 30 days prior to enrollment.\n22. Any contraindication for performing a brain MRI and/or Amyloid PET scan.\n23. Any participant whose safety the investigator considers to be at risk from this trial's intervention.\n24. Participants with any medically unstable/uncontrolled conditions.\n25. Any suicidal behavior in the past 2 years (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or preparatory acts or behavior).\n26. Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the C-SSRS in the past 3 months (i.e. active suicidal thought with intent but without specific plan, or active suicidal thought with plan and intent).",
