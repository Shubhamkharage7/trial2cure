The scientific premise of the proposed project is that an innovative EHR-embedded clinical decision support (CDS) tool can overcome the challenges to risk assessment and suggest pre-emptive use of behavioral techniques in the emergency setting. This would help clinicians appropriately invest resources to improve the quality of care for at-risk patients regardless of ultimate medical or psychiatric diagnoses and prevent agitation from occurring.\n\nThis pilot trial will (1) test the integrity of the study protocol in preparation for a future full-scale RCT, (2) evaluate randomization protocols, (3) estimate rates of recruitment and retention, (4) assess acceptability and fidelity of the intervention, and (5) determine if the proposed effect size is reasonable.\n\nThis registered study is actually the third aim of a larger study where the tool will be developed and assessed using observational data and input from a steering committee in aims 1 and 2 prior to pilot testing."
