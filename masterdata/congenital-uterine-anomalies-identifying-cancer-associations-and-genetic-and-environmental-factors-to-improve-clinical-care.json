            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the health outcomes associated with congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs), and the possible environmental and genetic causes of the condition. The researchers plan to investigate whether any cancer associations (with breast, renal, ovarian, vaginal and uterine cancers) exist in females with CUAs. The investigator will also investigate any environmental and genetic factors that may be responsible for causing CUAs.",
            "detailedDescription": "Aim 1: To identify female subjects diagnosed with a Congenital Uterine Anomaly (CUA) receiving care at Yale New Haven Health.\n\nAim 2: Identify (i) the prevalence of renal, breast, ovarian, uterine and vaginal cancers associated with CUAs, and (ii) the association of environmental factors, via a survey obtained by phone, email or interview.\n\nAim 3: Conduct genetic evaluation of the index subjects, parents, sister(s) (as feasible), and female offspring to identify potential causes and patterns of inheritance using whole exome sequencing (WES) and microarray.\n\nFollowing informed consent, blood will be collected for genetic evaluation. DNA will be extracted from EDTA-blood and analyzed using an integrated approach of microarray for copy number variations (CNV), and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for Single Nucleotide Variation (SNV).\n\nUndertaking review of the medical records will identify the cohort of patients we wish to survey to then ascertain further information regarding their CUA diagnosis and other related details. The information to be elicited from the survey are outlined in the attached survey questions. Key associations we seek to investigate include (1) the type and prevalence of renal, breast, ovarian, uterine and vaginal cancers among patients with Mullerian Anomaly, and (2) identifying potential in-utero exposure to particular environmental agents in patients with CUAs.\n\nReview of the medical records will enable us to undertake this first key step of establishing a cohort of subjects with MA and an initial data set related to their specific health information. We anticipate further investigations may build upon this initial data set, both with the cohort established, and more broadly with collaborators and additional national and international cohorts of patients with MA."
