            "briefSummary": "This study's overall goal is to enhance older adults' communication skills to access medication information and services to manage their medications safely and effectively. Med Wise Rx is an online 2-session program to improve communication skills for accessing medication information and services, leading to improved medication management. 160 adults age 65 years or older taking 4 or more medications will be on study for up to 9 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study's overall goal is to enhance older adults' communication skills to access medication information and services to manage their medications safely and effectively. Older adults are 2-3 times more likely to experience adverse drug events (ADEs) which are linked to falls, morbidity, hospitalization, loss of independence and death. More complicated regimens, poor adherence and poor communication contribute to this greater risk.\n\nThe Med Wise Rx Program is an evidence-informed two-session interactive behavioral workshop that has been delivered in partnership with Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) who informed the program design. This program was evaluated with 198 older adults in 8 Wisconsin counties and found a significant increase in participants' reported self-efficacy, communication skills and requests for medication checkups or comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs). There is a need for updating the Med Wise Rx program for dissemination virtually and to systematically examine the new design's effectiveness and implementation in organizations serving older adults.\n\nThe study team will conduct a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Med Wise Rx delivered through a new technology-supported mode of education. A randomized patient to group treatment trial with a waitlist control group for older adults and/or caregivers aged 65 or older will be used. A mixed-methods approach will be used, incorporating surveys, observational data collection, and interviews. The RE-AIM Framework will guide and inform the processes. In collaboration with the Community Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN) and five community partners associated with 7 counties, this dissemination and implementation study will:\n\n* AIM 1. Refine strategies to disseminate and implement the Med Wise Rx communication program through enhanced digital delivery methods.\n* AIM 2. Develop a facilitator training program that maximizes Med Wise Rx delivery fidelity in its new format.\n* AIM 3. Evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption/ acceptability, implementation/ enactment, and maintenance of the Med Wise Rx program delivery by Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) and participants at 8 weeks and 6 months post-delivery.\n\nProtocol Amendment 1/31/24 to remove 6-month follow up time point for cohorts enrolled this spring."
