Chronic inflammation drives disease development and contributes to symptoms experienced by patients with CCUS, LR-MDS, and MPN. Curcumin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties and has been studied in various chronic illnesses and hematologic diseases.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the change in inflammatory cytokine levels in study patients treated with curcumin versus placebo over a 12-month follow-up period.\n\nII. To compare the change in symptomatology in study patients treated with curcumin versus placebo over a 12-month follow-up period.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate the effect on variant allele frequency (VAF) of baseline mutations in study patients treated with curcumin versus placebo.\n\nII. To investigate the effect on methylation patterns in study patients treated with curcumin versus placebo.\n\nIII. To evaluate the effect on peripheral blood cells in study patients treated with curcumin versus placebo.\n\nIV. To assess the safety of curcumin for patients with CCUS/LR-MDS and symptomatic MPN who do not require disease-modifying therapy.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To investigate the correlation between inflammatory cytokine levels and symptom scores in study patients treated with curcumin versus placebo.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nArm I: Patients receive curcumin/demethoxycurcumin/bisdemethoxycurcumin-containing supplement (C3 complex)/piperine extract (standardized) (Bioperine) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at baseline and follow up, and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nArm II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at baseline and follow up, and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 10 years."
