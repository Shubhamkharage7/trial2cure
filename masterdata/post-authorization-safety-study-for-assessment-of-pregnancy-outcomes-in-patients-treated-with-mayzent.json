Pregnant women exposed to siponimod who do not meet the prospective cohort criteria will also be followed as part of an exposure series. All participants will be recruited via voluntary participant registration following informed consent by the pregnant woman for her participation.

Pregnant women\n2. Diagnosed with MS, with the indication validated by medical records when possible\n3. May or may not have taken another medication for MS in the current pregnancy\n4.

Women with exposure to any of the following medications within 5 half-lives prior to conception:\n\n   * Cladribine (Mavenclad)\n   * Based on the US label, animal studies indicate that there is positive evidence of teratogenicity for Cladribine\n   * All other S1P modulators including fingolimod (Gilenya), ozanimod, etc.\n   * S1P modulatros are in the same class of drug as siponimod\n   * Teriflunomide (Aubagio)\n   * The teratogenicity of teriflunomide is unknown and currently under investigation\n   * Other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody: same class as Kesimpta\n   * New medications (marketed after 2020) indicated for the treatment of MS will be evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria as the study progresses.\n4. Retrospective enrollment after the outcome of pregnancy is known (i.e. the pregnancy has ended prior to enrollment)\n5. Results of a diagnostic test are positive for a major structural defect prior to enrollment.

However, women who have had any normal or abnormal prenatal screening or diagnostic test prior to enrollment are eligible as long as the test result does not indicate a major structural defect.\n\nCohort 3: Healthy Comparison Cohort (Comparison Group 2):\n\n1. Exposure to Kesimpta 166 days before or to siponimod any time from the 4th day post first day of LMP prior to conception to and including end of pregnancy\n2. Women who have a diagnosis of a MS or a siponimod approved indication\n3. Women who have a current diagnosis of any autoimmune disease\n4. Women who have first contact with the project after prenatal diagnosis of any major structural defect\n5. Women who have enrolled in the siponimod cohort or Kesimpta cohort study with a previous pregnancy\n6. Women treated with Mayzent or Kesimpta for non-MS indication\n7. Retrospective enrollment after the outcome of pregnancy is known (i.e. the pregnancy has ended prior to enrollment)\n8. Results of a diagnostic test are positive for a major structural defect prior to enrollment.
