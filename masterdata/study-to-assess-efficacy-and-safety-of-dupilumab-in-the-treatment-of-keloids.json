Keloids, an abnormal proliferation of scar tissue, can be disfiguring, functionally impairing, and have dramatic impacts on quality of life. Treatments of keloids include a variety of modalities (i.e. intralesional steroid injections, silicone gel or sheets, surgery, laser, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, topical imiquimod, and intralesional 5-fluorouracil injections). However, current treatments are limited to primarily localized interventions.\n\nThe Investigators hypothesize that dupilumab can decrease the size and symptoms of keloids and improve patient's quality of life. An open-label proof of concept study regarding the use of dupilumab in patients with keloids may be the first step in elucidating a novel systematic approach to treatment of keloids."
