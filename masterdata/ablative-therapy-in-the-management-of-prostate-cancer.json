Information on treatment details will also be captured, including treatment time, anesthesia delivered, and length of stay, when applicable. Oncologic outcomes including PSA, post-treatment biopsy and imaging data, need for re-treatment, and survival outcomes will also be captured. Safety outcomes will be captured using the Clavien-Dindo classification scale, and additional specific GU complications will be recorded, which include urinary retention, urethral stricture, recto-urethral fistula, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infection. Finally, the investigators will capture functional outcomes using health related quality of life questionnaires including the EPIC questionnaire, IIEF-5, MSHQ-EjD, and IPSS."
