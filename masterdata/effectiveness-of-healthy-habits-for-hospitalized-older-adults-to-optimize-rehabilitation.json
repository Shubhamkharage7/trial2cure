Half of the subjects in this study will be assigned to an intervention that meets with a study therapist to discuss implementing healthy habits. The other half of subjects will assigned to an intervention group that meets with a study therapists to discuss implementing healthy sleep habits. Both groups will undergo several physical and cognitive assessments.",
            "detailedDescription": "Improving healthy habits such as sleep, nutrition or physical activity is expected to enhance rehabilitation in knee or hip arthroplasty patients, by increasing their ability to attend and adhere to rehabilitation recommendations following surgery. Half of the subjects in this study will be assigned to an intervention that meets with a study therapist to discuss implementing healthy habits (physical activity, nutrition, pain-coping techniques, etc). The other half of subjects will assigned to an intervention group that meets with a study therapists to discuss implementing healthy sleep habits. Both groups will undergo several physical and cognitive assessments at baseline (prior to surgery), post-hospital, post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up visit."

Meet DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder assessed by Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders.\n4. Score \u22658 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) or \u22655 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n5. Referral and attendance of medical rehabilitation post-discharge.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Evidence of recent severe mental health disorders (e.g., suicide attempt or psychiatric hospitalization in the past year).\n2. Presence of psychotic disorder, substance abuse or dependence, or bipolar disorder assessed by MINI International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (to increase generalizability other psychiatric comorbidities such as depression or anxiety will not be excluded).\n3. Untreated comorbid sleep disorders based on structured diagnostic interview including: narcolepsy, periodic leg movement disorder, and/or obstructive sleep apnea risk.\n4. Cognitive impairment defined as \\<20 on the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) that could potentially limit comprehension of the intervention. Note, while an MMSE of \\<24 is often used as a cutoff for cognitive impairment, we do not wish to exclude those with mild cognitive problems from this study as there is evidence that individuals with mild cognitive problems still benefit from insomnia treatments.",
