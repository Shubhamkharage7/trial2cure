Six RWHAP clinics will be selected to participate and be assigned to one of three sequences (two clinics per cluster). All members will complete participate in interactive trainings to raise awareness of and reduce SRD, from the clinic policy level, to attitudes, to the clinic environment. All clinic members and select patients will complete self-administered surveys every 6 months over 18 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The scope of this study is to engage Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) funded organizations in the South/East US to co-develop context-responsive programs utilizing evidence-informed interventions to reduce structural racism and discrimination (SRD) against Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) living with HIV (PLH) and BIPOC healthcare workers. SRD directly impacts access to and uptake of healthcare for BIPOC, including engagement in HIV services across the continuum of prevention and care. The proposed intervention, titled TRAnscenDS, draws on the evidence-based Health Policy Plus (HP+) 'total' facility HIV stigma-reduction intervention and Contact Theory of demonstrated efficacy in reducing race-related intergroup prejudice. TRAnscenDS targets the clinics' organizational (e.g.,anti-racist and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies) and systems (e.g., staff attitudes/behaviors) levels to affect patient (e.g., experienced and perceived discrimination, HIV care, mental health) outcomes and staff (e.g., job satisfaction) wellbeing, at the individual level. Findings will yield a Manual for implementing total-facility SRD-reduction processes and content. Other RWHAP-funded clinics and facilities serving marginalized groups may be able to adopt this manualized yet highly adaptable intervention packet to support BIPOC."

Other characteristics (e.g., poverty level) will be assessed at selection to ensure equivalence across the groups of clusters; selection of clinics will restrict on these variables. The criterion used to randomize clinics (by strata) to one of the 3 study sequences will be urbanicity (rural/suburban vs urban), which accounts for clinic size (# patients/year). Within each of the 2 strata, 3 clinics will be randomized to one of the 3 groups of clusters. Stratified Randomization will be conducted in Statistical Analysis System (SAS).",
