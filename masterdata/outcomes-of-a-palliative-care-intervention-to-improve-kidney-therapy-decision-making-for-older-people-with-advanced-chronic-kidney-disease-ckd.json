            "briefSummary": "The investigators are conducting a study to see if an educational program called Chronic Kidney Disease-Education (CKD-EDU) can help make better kidney therapy decisions and improve the well-being of older adults. Investigators are also investigating if this program can reduce the number of hospital or emergency room visits in the first 6 months of the study, as well as potentially improve end-of-life care for older adults.\n\nHalf of the participants will receive the CKD-EDU intervention, while the other half will continue with their usual nephrology care. Investigators will compare the two groups to see if participants who received the intervention feel better prepared about their kidney therapy decisions, experience improved end-of-life care, and have fewer emergency room visits, and hospital admissions.\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will get information about kidney disease treatment and meet with a palliative care specialist who's an expert in decision-making.",
            "detailedDescription": "Older adults \u226575 years represent the fastest-growing population to initiate dialysis in the US; despite the life-altering effects of dialysis on quality of life, dialysis is often presented as a default without considering patient preferences, prognosis, and alternative options such as conservative kidney management. This study will test the first palliative care intervention for older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease to improve the kidney therapy decision-making process. This research not only has the potential to help thousands of older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease who often have unanswered questions, unmet information needs, and restricted opportunities to share personal treatment preferences with their nephrologists but also has the possibility of creating new models of collaborative care by integrating palliative care into routine nephrology care."
