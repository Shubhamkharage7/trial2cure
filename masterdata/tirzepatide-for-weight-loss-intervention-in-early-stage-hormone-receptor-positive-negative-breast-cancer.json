            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of tirzepatide in achieving a 5% or more body weight reduction in patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/Her2-) breast cancer. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of tirzepatide, its feasibility based on discontinuation rates, and completion of treatment. Secondary objectives include evaluating 3-year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), changes in BMI and body fat distribution, metabolic markers, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the proportion of patients who achieve a 5% or greater reduction in body weight by the end of the study treatment with tirzepatide, during adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/Her2-) breast cancer. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of tirzepatide for weight loss during this treatment. The feasibility of using tirzepatide for weight loss intervention will be evaluated through discontinuation rates and completion of the treatment course. Additionally, the trial will determine the 3-year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and 3-year distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) with the use of tirzepatide. The study will also assess changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), body fat distribution (measured via Waist/Hip Ratio (WHR) and waist circumference), and obesity-related metabolic markers (including Blood Pressure, fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, HgbA1c, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, IGF1, estrogen, and testosterone). Finally, the trial will monitor for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and assess changes when using tirzepatide for weight loss in the adjuvant treatment of HR+/Her2- breast cancer. Quality of Life assessments will be obtained and exploratory objectives investigating adipokines (adiponectin, leptin) and their receptors, metabolomic pathways and immune cell metabolism will be conducted."

                    "description": "This outcome measures the effect of tirzepatide on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels, which potentially serve as an early indicator of cancer recurrence in participants undergoing adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/Her2-) breast cancer. The primary focus is to detect ctDNA and monitor changes in its levels throughout the treatment duration. Assessing ctDNA levels can provide insights into the molecular response to obesity treatment using tirzepatide.",
