This trial will enroll a total of 76 children and adolescents with moderate to severe AA (affecting at least 30% of the scalp) at the time of screening with a targeted 61 participants completing through Week 48. All subjects must have evidence of hair regrowth within the last 7 years of their last episode of hair loss; and have screening IgE \u2265200 and/or have personal and/or familial history of atopy.\n\nStudy participation will be up to 124 weeks, consisting of: a screening period of up to 4 weeks; a 48-week placebo-controlled period; a 48-week open-label extension period; followed by a 24-week follow-up period.",
            "detailedDescription": "After providing consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility during the screening period (within 4 weeks of Baseline), which includes a review of past and current medical conditions, detailed review of past and current medications, a physical examination, clinical assessments, and laboratory tests for safety. Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for eligibility will undergo Baseline assessments at Week 0. Subjects will return for visits every 8-16 weeks for repeat clinical assessments, medication reviews, and monitoring for adverse events. Female subjects will undergo a urine pregnancy test (where applicable) at each of these visits."
