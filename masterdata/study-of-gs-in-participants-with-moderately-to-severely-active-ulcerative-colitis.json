The study will compare participants in different treatment groups treated with GS-1427 with participants treated with placebo (Part 1), and participants treated with GS-1427 or ustekinumab alone with participants treated with GS-1427 in combination with ustekinumab (Part 2).\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are:\n\nPart 1: To assess the efficacy of GS-1427, compared with placebo control, in achieving clinical response at Week 12\n\nPart 2: To assess the efficacy of combination therapy with GS-1427 and ustekinumab, compared with GS-1427 and ustekinumab monotherapies, in achieving clinical response at Week 12"
