            "briefSummary": "The neurosurgical standard of care for treating a patient with a tumor invading hand primary motor cortex (M1) includes performing a craniotomy with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) mapping and to resect as much tumor as possible without a resultant permanent neurological deficit. However, the subjective nature of current intraoperative hand motor assessments do not offer a comprehensive understanding of how hand strength and function may be impacted by resection. Additionally, there is a paucity of data to inform how altering DES parameters may effect motor mapping. Here, the investigators seek to demonstrate a feasible, standardized protocol to quantitatively assess hand strength and function and systematically assess several stimulation parameters to improve intraoperative measurements and better understand how cortical stimulation interacts with underlying neural function."
