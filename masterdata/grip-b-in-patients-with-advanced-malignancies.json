            "briefSummary": "This phase I/II clinical trial evaluates if using a radiotracer targeting granzyme B, 64-copper granzyme targeting restricted interaction peptide specific to family member B (64 Cu-GRIP B) with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be safe and useful for detecting granzyme B (GrB) in patients with advanced cancers that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (advanced). Granzyme B (GrB) is a biomarker produced by immune cells in response to immunotherapy, which may highlight tumors that are more likely to respond to treatment. The study population is focused on genitourinary (GU) malignancies, including renal cell and urothelial cancer, two tumor types with high mutational burden and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared to other tumor types, and have a predictable response rate at the population level to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The information gained from this trial may allow researchers to develop future trials where 64Cu-GRIP B PET may serve as a biomarker to monitor early response to immunomodulatory therapies which are used to stimulate or suppress the immune system and may help the body fight cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety, dosimetry, and pharmacokinetics of 64Cu-GRIP B PET in patients with metastatic GU malignancy (renal, urothelial, or prostate) (3 males, 3 females). (Cohort A) II. To determine the mean percent change in both tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and ratio of SUVmax//blood average standardized uptake value (SUVave) on 64Cu-GRIP B PET in patients with participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC) (Cohort B) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Cohort C).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and average organ dosimetry of 64Cu-GRIP B PET in patients with participants with metastatic RCC and UC (Cohort B), mCRPC (Cohort C) or other solid tumor malignancies (Cohort D).\n\nII. To descriptively report the patterns of intra-tumoral uptake of 64Cu-GRIP B on whole body PET, including by site of disease, uptake by tumor type, inter-tumoral and inter-patient heterogeneity, and tumor-to-background signal in patients with participants with metastatic RCC and UC (Cohort B), mCRPC (Cohort C), or other solid tumor malignancies (Cohort D).\n\nIII. To descriptively report PET at grade \\>= 2 immune-related adverse event(s) in patients with metastatic RCC and UC (Cohort B) who have 64Cu-GRIP B PET performed within 14 days of onset of event.\n\nIV. To descriptively report the number of lesions identified on 64Cu-GRIP B PET compared with conventional imaging in patients with participants with metastatic RCC and UC (Cohort B), mCRPC (Cohort C), or other solid tumor malignancies (Cohort D).\n\nV. To determine whether baseline uptake on 64Cu-GRIP B PET is associated with subsequent clinical outcomes including objective response, progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen 50% reduction (PSA50) response, and immune-related adverse events in participants with metastatic RCC and UC (Cohort B), mCRPC (Cohort C), or other solid tumor malignancies (Cohort D).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts:\n\nCohort A: Participants with metastatic GU malignancy (renal,urothelial, or prostate) Cohort B: Participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or urothelial cancer (UC).\n\nCohort C: Participants with mCRPC Cohort D: Participants with solid tumor malignancies\n\nAll participants will receive 64Cu-GRIP B PET at baseline. For participants in Cohorts B and C, another PET scan will be performed 8 weeks and at disease progression. Participants in Cohort D will undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI throughout the study and may undergo an optional 64Cu-GRIP B PET at the time of progression. Safety monitoring includes adverse event assessment at screening, 60 minutes (+/- 15 min), 2 hours (+/- 30 min), and 24 hours (+/- 4 hours) following 64Cu-GRIP B injections. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years for longitudinal endpoints."
