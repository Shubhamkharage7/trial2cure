The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy and adherence of \"Destination Cardiac Rehab\" compared to traditional center-based CR.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed virtual world-based cardiac rehabilitation (VWCR) program provides a novel home-based delivery method of a CR program to address several barriers to care associated with traditional center-based CR (CBCR). This 2-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will rigorously assess adherence and efficacy of VWCR compared to CBCR in a 12-week (36-session) intervention that includes patient education, self-monitoring of physical activity and blood pressure, social support, and weekly telehealth visits with a CR nurse and exercise physiologist. Patients with a CR eligible cardiovascular event will be recruited from 6 geographically diverse CR centers across the United States. We hypothesize that the VWCR, known as \"Destination Cardiac Rehab\" will be non-inferior to CBCR as assessed by improvement in cardiovascular health and adherence to CR sessions."
