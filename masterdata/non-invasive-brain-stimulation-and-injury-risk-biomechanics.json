            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (theta burst stimulation) on movement biomechanics (jump landing) among individuals with and without a concussion history. The main question it aims to answer is if theta burst stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improves single- and dual-task jump landing reaction time and jump landing biomechanics compared to a control site (vertex) for individuals with and without a concussion history.\n\nParticipants will be asked to perform a jump landing before and after the experimental (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and control (vertex) theta burst stimulation protocol. The researchers will compare individuals with and without a concussion history to see if the effects differ between groups.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of the project is to determine how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (theta burst stimulation) influences movement among individuals with and without a concussion history. The purpose of this study is prevention via improving injury risk biomechanics to reduce the risk of future musculoskeletal injury.\n\nParticipants will complete 2 testing sessions separated by a minimum of 7 days.\n\nDuring the first testing session, participants will complete single-task serial subtraction, single- and dual-task jump landing, and a theta burst stimulation intervention. The jump landing will be completed before and after theta burst stimulation and under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. During the second testing session, participants will complete the jump landing before and after theta burst stimulation under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions.\n\nOn both testing sessions, the symptom checklist and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11 (TSK-11) will be administered upon arrival to the lab (after informed consent on day 1), and immediately after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Godin Leisure Activity Questionaire will be administered on both days before the jump landing. The NASA Task Load index will be administered on both days immediately after the completion of every cognitive and motor task.\n\nAt the end of the second day of testing, the participants will be asked which day the participants believed the participants received the experimental and control conditions of the theta burst stimulation intervention.\n\nThis is a single-blinded cross-over design study. The participants will be unaware of when the participants receive the true (experimental) and control (placebo) theta burst stimulation intervention. Experimental (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and control (vertex) conditions will be counterbalanced for the concussion history group. The control group will be matched to their respective concussion history group counterpart's counterbalanced order."
