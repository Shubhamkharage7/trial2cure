In Cohort, enrolled women will receive NOE-115 at a daily Dose A for the entire 4-week treatment period. Cohort 1 participants will return to the clinic on specified days per protocol for tolerability assessments.\n\nCohort 2 will enroll participants after the acceptable safety/tolerability of NOE-115 Dose A has been determined from Cohort 1.\n\nAdministration of NOE-115 will start on Study Day 1 and will continue daily for 4 weeks and will start at Dose A of NOE-115 as defined by the study protocol. Participants will receive NOE-115 up to a maximum- daily dose based on Investigator decision. Cohort 2 participants will return to the clinic on specified days per protocol for tolerability assessments and possible dose increases of NOE-115."
