Participants will take part in a series of pre-intervention assessments, the brain stimulation intervention consisting of 20 once-daily 20-minute stimulation sessions given over a period of 4 weeks, and a series of post-intervention assessments (taken immediately after brain stimulation and 3 months after stimulation)."
