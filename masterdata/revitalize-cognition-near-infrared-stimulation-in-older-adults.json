            "briefSummary": "Changes in mood and cognition are common in older adulthood. Some studies have suggested that transcranial application of near-infrared (NIR) light may have enhancing effects on cognitive and mood status in young adults and individuals with traumatic brain injury. This effect has not been examined in older adults. This study will involve a randomized sham-controlled trial to learn whether NIR stimulation improves cognition and mood in older adults, relative to sham treated controls.",
            "detailedDescription": "There is a dearth of clinically meaningful treatment options at this point in time for individuals who are at increased risk for transitioning to dementia, particularly those with the amnestic variant of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). While waiting for causative cures and preventive approaches, investigators are faced with the task of identifying modifying therapies that might alter the course or slow down the transition from normal cognition to MCI to dementia.\n\nThe proposed study hopes to contribute to this mission by testing the viability of a different type of intervention, one involving transcranial delivery of near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (808-904nm). Near-infrared stimulation is safe, non-invasive and appears to improve mitochondrial function by promoting increased production of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and possibly improved blood flow. Perhaps most compelling are recent findings of reduced beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic Alzheimer's mouse models after exposure to real vs sham transcranial NIR stimulation. Preliminary human involving traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and young adult populations have also been promising in terms of positive effects of NIR on cognition.\n\nThe overall goal of the present study is to learn whether this unconventional NIR stimulation approach has potential for improving cognition in older adults. To do so, investigators will conduct a randomized sham controlled pilot trial. The intervention will involve six sessions, over a 2-week period in which real or sham stimulation is transcranially applied using a delivery system that has been FDA-approved as a nonsignificant risk since 2003. Researchers hope to learn whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham, has positive effects on cognition and mood in older adults."
