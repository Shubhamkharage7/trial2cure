To identify misestimations about the risks and benefits of immunotherapy resulting from media hype or other sources and assess if these misestimations persist post-provider conversation about immunotherapy.\n\nII. To qualitatively describe patient reported misunderstandings and to assess patient understanding of technical terms and metaphors used in the immunotherapy conversation.\n\nIII. To identify provider and patient preferences for information to be communicated about immunotherapy.\n\nIV. Develop videos that describe immunotherapy and test their efficacy in improving understanding using pre and post methodology.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients and their providers undergo observation during a conversation about immunotherapy. Then participate in an interview over 20 minutes. Understanding of educational videos is then tested."
