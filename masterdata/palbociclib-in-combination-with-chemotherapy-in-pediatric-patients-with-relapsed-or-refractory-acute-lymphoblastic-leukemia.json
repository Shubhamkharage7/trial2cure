Adequate central nervous system (CNS) function defined as\n\n   1. Subjects with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on allowed anti convulsants and well controlled. Benzodiazepines and gabapentin are acceptable.\n   2. CNS toxicity \\< Grade 2\n10. Adequate peripheral nervous system (PNS) function defined as PNS toxicity \\< Grade 2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Extramedullary disease status: subjects with isolated CNS disease or isolated testicular disease are not eligible.\n2. Concurrent chemotherapy or targeted anti cancer agents, other than intrathecal therapy.\n3. Subjects who have previously received bortezomib or other proteasome inhibitors that did not have a response while receiving the inhibitor are not eligible. Subjects that responded but had a subsequent relapse are eligible.\n4. Subjects who have previously received palbociclib or other CDK4/6 inhibitors are not eligible.\n5. Subject with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair participation in the study or the evaluation of safety and/or efficacy.\n6. Subjects that have an active, uncontrolled infection are not eligible.\n7. Known HIV infection or active hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-positive) or C (defined as hepatitis C antibody-positive).\n8.

Cumulative anthracyclines must not be projected to exceed 450 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents following completion of treatment on protocol. Therefore, for subjects receiving one course on protocol cumulative anthracyclines cannot exceed 400 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents at the time of enrollment (\u2264 200 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents for subject with prior radiation therapy to the mediastinum).\n11.
