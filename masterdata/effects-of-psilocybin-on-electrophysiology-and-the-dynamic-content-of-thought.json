            "detailedDescription": "In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, full cross-over study in healthy volunteers, computerized, electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures will be assessed to test the acute effects of a moderate dose of psilocybin (10 mg/70 kg) on creativity, the contents and dynamics of thought, memory, and shared vs individual brain response while viewing naturalistic stimuli. Understanding the acute psychological and neural effects of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin may allow for future optimization of psychedelic medicine, as well as a deeper and more refined understanding of consciousness itself."
