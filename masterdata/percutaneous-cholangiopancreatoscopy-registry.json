The prospective component of the registry will run for three years at each site where patients undergoing the clinically indicated percutaneous cholangiopancreatoscopy procedure will be enrolled in the study, and the patients' data will be collected whenever the patients present to interventional radiology (IR) for a procedure or clinic visit."

Next, either, the stones will then be removed from the biliary system or gallbladder using a combination of baskets, and lithotripsy equipment as required, or in case of biliary strictures, a clamshell biopsy will be taken from the stricture site as identified on endoscopic visualization and cross-sectional imaging. Further intervention maybe performed for the stricture based on operator preference.
