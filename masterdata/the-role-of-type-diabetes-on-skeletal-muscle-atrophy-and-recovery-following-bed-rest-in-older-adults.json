            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine the impact of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes on muscle atrophy during a period of bed rest and recovery of muscle mass, strength, and physical function following bed rest.",
            "detailedDescription": "Older adults with type 2 diabetes experience an accelerated rate of sarcopenia, which is the deterioration in muscle mass, strength and physical performance. Periods of disuse caused by illness or hospitalization cause rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which negatively impact physical function upon re-ambulation. The impact of type 2 diabetes on acute muscle atrophy and recovery from disuse is a critical issue that has not been investigated.\n\nThe overall objectives of this study are to employ highly innovative methods in muscle biopsy specimens in order to decipher the temporal sequence by which mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity in older adults with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes impact atrophy and recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function following bed rest. Older adults with and without pre-diabetes/type 2 diabetes will complete 10 days of strict bed rest followed by 4 weeks of ambulatory recovery. During bed rest muscle biopsies will be collected to determine mitochondrial function and lipid profile. During the recovery period the recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function will be determined."
