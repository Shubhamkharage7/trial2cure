Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence following completion of radiation therapy.\n* After undergoing surgery, patients may be optimally or sub optimally debulked.\n* Patients with measurable recurrent disease of any previous substage (I-IV) are eligible to enrollment.\n* Patients must have adequate bone marrow function: WBC greater than or equal to 3,000/ul, Platelets greater than or equal to 75,000/ul, Granulocytes greater than or equal to 1500/ul.\n* Patients must have adequate renal function: creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL.\n* Patients must have adequate hepatic function: bilirubin \u2264 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal, aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\], and alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 IULN or \u2264 5 \u00d7 IULN if known liver metastases\n* Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Patients must have signed an approved informed consent.\n* Patients must be at least 2 weeks beyond prior treatment (chemotherapy, investigational drugs including small molecular inhibitors, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy) or major surgery.\n* Patients must be at least 2 weeks beyond high dose systemic corticosteroids (however, low dose corticosteroids \\< or equal to 20 mg prednisone or equivalent daily are permitted)\n* Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities to Grade 1 or less from adverse events due to a previously administered agent Note: Patients with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy or \u2264 Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study Note: If patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy\n* Patients with recurrent disease may have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapies for treatment of their cervical cancer.\n* Patients may have received prior immunotherapy therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. A 4-week washout period is required between prior immunotherapy treatment and first dose of sacituzumab govitecan.\n* Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception during the study and until conclusion of 12-week post-treatment evaluation period.\n* Patients must be at least 18 years of age.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a positive serum pregnancy test or women who are breastfeeding.\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to the study drug, its metabolites, or formulation excipient.\n* Patients who require ongoing therapy with or prior use of any prohibited medication(s) such as UGT1A1 inhibitors.\n* Have other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of study procedures and follow-up examinations.\n* Any medical condition that, in the investigator's or sponsor's opinion, poses an undue risk to the patient's participation in the study.\n* Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last 5 years.\n* Patients with a significant history of cardiac disease within 6 months, i.e., uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA classification III-IV) or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia (other than stable atrial fibrillation) requiring antiarrhythmia therapy.\n* Patients with known history of clinically significant active COPD, or other moderate-to-severe chronic respiratory illness present within 6 months\n* Patients with any unstable medical issue (including cardiac issues as above, active treatment for symptomatic pulmonary embolism, CVA, renal or hepatic insufficiency, and active infection/sepsis requiring IV antibiotics).\n* Have known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and all neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are taking \u226420 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. All patients with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* Patients who have an uncontrolled seizure disorder, or active neurological disease.\n* Have known history of HIV-1 or 2 (or positive HIV-1/2 antibody) with detectable viral load OR taking medications that may interfere with SN-38 metabolism\n* Have active HBV or HCV. In subjects with a history of HBV or HCV, subjects with a detectable viral load will be excluded.\n* Known hemorrhagic diathesis or active bleeding disorder.\n* Patients with Gilbert's disease\n* Presence of bulky disease (defined as any single mass \\>7 cm in its greatest dimension). Patients with a mass over 7 cm, but otherwise eligible, may be considered for enrollment after discussion and approval with the study PI.\n* Patients with active \u2265 grade 2 anorexia, nausea or vomiting, and/or signs of intestinal obstruction.\n* Prior history of intestinal obstruction within 6 months of initiation of study treatment.\n* Patients with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to irinotecan or \u2265 Grade 3 toxicity to prior irinotecan.\n* Have previously received topoisomerase I inhibitors",
