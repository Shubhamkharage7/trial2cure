Once consented and enrolled, baseline demographic and psychosocial data will be obtained. Participants will receive 12 weeks of CGM supplies at no cost to them and provided with initial standard CGM introduction and education. Participants will then be randomized to receive ONBOARD or CGM-only. Those randomized to the ONBOARD condition will schedule 4 60-minute sessions with study interventionist (every 2 weeks). Hemoglobin A1c values, CGM usage data, and psychosocial data will be collected at baseline, 3-months (post-intervention), and 6- and 12-months post-baseline."
