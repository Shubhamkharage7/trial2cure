            "briefSummary": "Participants of this study are adults with GEP-NETs and/or acromegaly who were using the Ipsen lanreotide syringe and have transitioned in the last 6 months to the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe, having received at least two injections using the Pharmathen syringe.\n\nGEP-NETs are abnormal growths that develop in the digestive system, including the stomach, intestines, and pancreas. These tumors arise from special cells called neuroendocrine cells, which are found in these organs and release hormones to regulate various bodily functions. GEP-NETs can be slow-growing, and symptoms may vary depending on their location and size.\n\nAcromegaly is a condition where a person's body produces too much growth hormone. This excess hormone can cause certain body parts, like the hands, feet, and face, to enlarge over time. It typically occurs because of a tumor on the pituitary gland in the brain, which is responsible for regulating hormones. Acromegaly can lead to various health issues if not treated, but medications or surgery can often help manage the condition.\n\nLong-acting somatostatin analogs (LA-SSAs) are indicated for patients with Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and acromegaly who are not eligible for surgery or when surgery fails to achieve remission.\n\nData for this study will be collected after the treatment switch from the Ipsen lanreotide syringe to the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe has occurred, using one round of one-to-one qualitative telephone and/or videoconference interviews with patients. Interviews will last 45 minutes and be carried out in the local language of the participant's country.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to capture the patient experience of the Ipsen lanreotide syringe and their experience with the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe."
