            "briefSummary": "The goals of treating knee osteoarthritis (OA) is to improve or maintain quality of life, mobility and function, pain relief, and improve inflammation. The different treatment options for knee OA have been extensively studied and implemented, but the optimum treatment is still undecided. There is a belief that anti-inflammatory sleeve technology may be beneficial in treating knee OA. The purpose of this study is to determine if the Reparel\u2122 knee sleeve results in superior mobility, functionality, and pain outcomes as compared to a placebo knee sleeve in managing knee OA.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients who are recommended non-operative management of their knee osteoarthritis and have consented to participate in the study will be randomized into two groups to receive either of the following\n\n1. Reparel knee sleeve\n2. Placebo knee sleeve\n\nParticipants assigned to both groups will be given instructions on how to use/wear the sleeve while performing activities of daily living or sports that had previously resulted in knee pain and also be asked to do the follows:\n\n* Wear the sleeve as much as they possibly can\n* Not change their usual activities and diet during the time they are on this study.\n* Record in a diary the number of hours sleeve was worn per day\n* Record any adverse effects or discomfort due to sleeve use.\n* Not to receive any injections in the subsequent 6 months following baseline randomization visit.\n\nParticipant background information that is relevant to this study will also be collected from their medical record including age, sex, and race and stored in a hospital secure computer database (REDCap).\n\nParticipants will also be asked to complete the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Lysholm Score, UCLA Activity Score and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) survey questionnaires at baseline randomization visit (T0), at 4 weeks (T1), at 3 months (T2), and at 6 months (T3) to assess the mobility, functionality, and pain associated with the affected leg.\n\nThe responses to the surveys will be recorded on a password-protected laptop and all patient identifiers will be replaced with unique identifier numbers. Only the study team will have access to the responses from the forms. The analysis of de-identified data will be done through SPSS 27, and scores for the questionnaires will be averaged and compared between the two groups."
