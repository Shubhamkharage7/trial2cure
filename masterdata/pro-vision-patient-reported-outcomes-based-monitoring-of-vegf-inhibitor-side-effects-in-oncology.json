This study is specifically investigating this approach in patients taking oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).\n\nParticipants in this study will receive a survey via email or telephone once a week while receiving treatment with a VEGFR TKI. The survey will ask about symptoms such as nausea or fatigue and overall quality of life. This survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete.\n\nThe survey will be sent directly to the oncology care team. Participants will receive a follow-up phone call or message from the team when participants have new or worsening symptoms. The participants will continue to receive surveys for as long as they are receiving a VEGF TKI treatment."
