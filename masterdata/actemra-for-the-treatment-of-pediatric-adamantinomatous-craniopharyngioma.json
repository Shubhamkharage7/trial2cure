            "briefSummary": "ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) is an IL-6 receptor antagonist used for the treatment of adult Rheumatoid Arthritis as well as Polyarticular (PJIA) and Systemic (SJIA) Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. In this Phase II, the drug will be used to treat pediatric patients diagnosed with recurrent Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma including patients who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a highly debilitating pediatric brain tumor that lacks medical anti-tumor therapies. Current therapy, which depends largely on surgery and radiation, is associated with poor quality of life and becomes more challenging and risky in the setting of recurrent disease. Recent discoveries regarding the biological characteristics of ACP indicate that available agents, including IL-6 pathway blockers may have efficacy in the control of ACP. We hypothesize that the IL6- receptor antagonist ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) will be safe and effective at inducing tumor response in children with residual ACP.\n\nIn this study, up to 38 patients will receive tocilizumab at the dose approved for pediatric Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (\\< 30 kg: 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks; \u226530 kg: 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks). Therapy may continue for up to two years (26 cycles).\n\nIt will be a multi-center Phase 2 trial with two strata for patients aged \\>1 year and \\<25 years with unresectable ACP who may have been previously treated with radiation (Stratum 1, 18 patients) or without radiation (Stratum 2, 18 patients)."
