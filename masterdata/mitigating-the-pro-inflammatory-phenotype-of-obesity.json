Using a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-design approach, we hypothesize that 4 weeks of SNA blockade (oral clonidine) will cause a significant reduction in expression of inflammatory markers in blood, endothelial cells, and central adipose compared with a BP-lowering control condition using hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and a separate placebo treatment.\n2.
