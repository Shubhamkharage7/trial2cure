            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to explore a potential role of nitrous oxide in treating pain associated with fibromyalgia.",
            "detailedDescription": "Investigators are conducting this trial to determine the efficacy of nitrous oxide on fibromyalgia, a chronic, debilitating, disorder typified by widespread musculoskeletal pain, accompanied by symptoms of fatigue, affected sleep, memory issues, and mood disorders.\n\nStudies suggests that the chronic widespread pain seen in fibromyalgia patients has a neurogenic origin. Higher levels of ascending pathway neurochemicals, including nerve growth factor, substance P, and brain derived neurotrophic factor, are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of fibromyalgia patients when compared to healthy controls. In addition, glutamate levels can be elevated in both the CSF and brain of fibromyalgia patients. Glutamate may play a central role, by acting on the NMDA-receptors to increase the central amplification of pain perception, which is thought to manifest as allodynia and hyperalgesia in fibromyalgia patients. NMDA-receptors are thus an attractive target for fibromyalgia therapeutic drug development.\n\nIn four other randomized controlled trial(s) to evaluate ketamine an NMDA-receptor antagonist; two demonstrated an acute reduction in VAS pain scores (20- to -25 points) 90- to 120-minutes following IV ketamine 0.3 mg/kg compared with placebo; while the other two using different drug concentrations and dose regimen (0.3 mg/kg over 30 minutes and 0.5 mg/kg for 3 hours) showed a 0.5- to 0.9-point reduction in pain scores (10-cm VAS) at 90 to 180 minutes following IV ketamine compared with placebo. Although all four trials demonstrated significant acute pain improvement during and immediately following the infusions, there were no sustained improvements.\n\nGiven nitrous oxide is another drug with known NMDA-receptor antagonism, this trial will evaluate the efficacy of inhaled 50% nitrous oxide compared to placebo (oxygen-air mixture). Study participants with a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia, meeting 2016-Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria (2016-ACR) and neuropathic pain criterion will be randomly assigned to receive two, 60-minute inhalation sessions (50% nitrous oxide and placebo).\n\nTreatment outcomes will be monitored using diagnostic tools measuring functionality, pain, and mood:\n\n* Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)\n* Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR)\n* Patients Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC)\n* Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\n* Computerized Adaptive Test-Mental Health (CAT-MH)"
