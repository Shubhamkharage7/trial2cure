All patients will have a planned mid-induction bone marrow assessment as standard of care. All patients will subsequently be observed for count recovery, regardless of bone marrow results and in the absence of peripheral blood disease proliferation, and an end of induction bone marrow biopsy will be performed either at count recovery or between days 28 and 42 in the absence of count recovery. Patients with complete remission (CR) will proceed to consolidation chemotherapy as determined by the treating investigator. Patients with refractory disease will proceed to further therapy as determined by the treating investigator. All patients will be followed for long-term outcomes."
