            "briefSummary": "This study will fill a scientific gap in the current knowledge providing data for evaluation of the palatal augmentation prosthesis (PAP) as a therapeutic modality in a robust scientific randomized prospective clinical trial.\n\nPositive outcomes from this study have the potential to dramatically alter the most common issues of oral cancer therapy, namely speech and swallowing functions. Patients will have been diagnosed with a cancer lesion on their tongue requiring surgery and removal of part of the tongue. Smaller cancers of the tongue are sized as T1 or T2. For patients with smaller lesions, a PAP, which can aid in speaking and swallowing is not routinely provided with the device.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will randomize patients into two arms; one for oral cancer patients that receive a small device, similar to a denture, called a PAP. The other arm will be patients who are a control and who will not receive a PAP.\n\nThe PAP requires patients to have a dental mold created. A dentist customizes the PAP to fit their mouth.\n\nThe study will investigate whether the PAP improves speech following tongue cancer as measured by three different scales. Both groups will see a speech language therapist to have their speech evaluated."
