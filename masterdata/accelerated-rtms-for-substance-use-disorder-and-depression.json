Participants will be recruited from an existing and ongoing longitudinal study of stimulant use disorder (STIM-RAD) (NCT06073340). Prior to initiating the accelerated course of rTMS, participants will undergo screening procedures to evaluate eligibility. Those eligible will complete up to four (4) rTMS sessions of intermittent theta burst over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex per day, up to five (5) days per week of the study, for a total of 50 sessions over a three (3) week period and will undergo electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), urine drug screens, as well as self-report and clinician-rated assessments. A follow-up visit will be conducted 1 week after the last session of rTMS."
