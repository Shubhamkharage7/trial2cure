The main question to answer is whether teachers increase their use of a target classroom management practice when they receive the intervention. All participants will receive the intervention. The target practice for which they receive intervention will be randomly assigned. Participants will submit videos of an instructional activity in their classroom 1-2 times per week over a period of 12-15 weeks. They will be asked to complete online modules on classroom management practices and to self-monitor their use of one classroom management practice. Participants may also be asked to graph their data, watch videos of themselves teaching, or implement peer coaching with a classmate or other participant. Researchers will compare the change in target classroom management practices between groups to test if the change in the group who targeted the practice is greater than the change in the group who did not target the practice."
