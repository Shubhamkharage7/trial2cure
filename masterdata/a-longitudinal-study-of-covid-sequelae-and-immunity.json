            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It infects the respiratory tract. Some people who get COVID-19 have only mild symptoms. But for others, infection leads to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and, in some cases, death. Researchers want to learn more about any effects that may persist after people recover from COVID-19.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn about any long-term medical problems that people who have recovered from COVID-19 might have, and whether they develop an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that provides protection against reinfection.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople age 18 and older who have recovered from documented COVID-19 or were in close contact with someone who had COVID-19 but did not get the infection\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened over 2 visits. During visit 1, they will answer questions about any symptoms they are having and will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection which will involve a nasal swab sample or other FDA approved test. If the test is negative, they will proceed to the second visit, which will include:\n\nPhysical examination\n\nMedical history\n\nMental health interview (which may be recorded if the participant agrees)\n\nChest x-ray (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)\n\nBlood and urine tests\n\nPregnancy test (if needed)\n\nLung function test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)\n\n6-minute walk test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)\n\nQuestionnaires about their general and mental health\n\nLeukapheresis to collect white blood cells (optional).\n\nParticipants will be put into 1 of 2 groups: the COVID-19 group or the close contact group.\n\nParticipants will have study visits every 6 months for 3 years. They will repeat some of the screening tests. Participants in the COVID-19 group may have visits more often if they develop symptoms that suggest re-infection with SARS-CoV-2....",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis is a longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the clinical sequelae of acute COVID-19 and characterize the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Household contacts of the COVID-19 cohort will also be recruited and serve as a control group.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Characterize the medical sequalae and persistent symptoms following recovery from COVID-19 in a cohort of disease survivors.\n* Estimate the incidence and risk factors for post-COVID-19 medical sequalae.\n* Characterize antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV- 2 in disease survivors\n* Characterize evolution of the antibody and T cell-mediated responses to SARS-CoV-2 in survivors over time\n* Evaluate survivors for evidence of re-infection with future waves of COVID-19 to determine if initial infection confers long-term protective immunity\n* Determine the incidence of clinically silent infection in household contacts\n* Characterize the mental health status of survivors and controls including medical trauma related sequelae\n\nEndpoint:\n\nEstablish a clinically well characterized cohort of persons recovered from COVID-19 and close contacts of persons with COVID-19"
