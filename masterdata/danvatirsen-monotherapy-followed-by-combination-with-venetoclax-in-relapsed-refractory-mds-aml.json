            "briefSummary": "This is a Phase 1 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Danvatirsen as a monotherapy followed by combination with Venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). \\[(FDA OOPD)\\]",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Danvatirsen as a monotherapy followed by combination with Venetoclax in patients with intermediate/high/very high myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) as determined by revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have relapsed or are refractory to frontline therapy. Danvatirsen is a next generation, high affinity, antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (or STAT3) that has shown preclinical activity in vitro and good intracellular uptake in vivo in primary patient MDS and AML stem cells. STAT3 is a transcription factor that is overexpressed and dysregulated in several malignancies. Venetoclax is a commercially available, potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of B-cell Lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), an anti-apoptotic protein found on some types of cancer cells. Prior studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between STAT3 \\& Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) overexpression. MCL-1 is a multi-domain anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the BCL-2 family, which regulates the intrinsic apoptosis pathways and plays a central role in mediating therapeutic resistance to novel therapies such as Venetoclax in MDS and AML.\n\nWhile FDA approved therapies have moved the field forward in newly diagnosed AML, relapsed/refractory (R/R) MDS and R/R AML continue to have a dismal prognosis, with a median overall survival of 4-10 months.\n\nThe study team has designed an innovative clinical trial to study Danvatirsen as monotherapy followed by combination with venetoclax for the treatment of relapsed/refractory high-risk MDS/AML. The study team plans to incorporate several important pharmacodynamic endpoints that will provide a real-time assessment of the effect of STAT3 inhibition in MDS/AML stem \\& progenitor cells and the impact on target gene expression. These correlative studies will help identify subsets of patients that are most likely to respond to STAT3 inhibition. Although direct targeting and monitoring of aberrant stem cells has recently gained some traction in AML, it is a novel approach for the treatment of MDS.\n\nThis study has been designed as a Phase 1 dose-escalation protocol of 2 different sub-studies to evaluate the safety profile, determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Danvatirsen monotherapy followed by combination with Venetoclax once safety of Danvatirsen monotherapy is established. Patients with intermediate/high/very high IPSS-R MDS or AML who have relapsed/or are refractory to all available frontline therapy with no FDA approved treatment options will be enrolled in both the sub-studies. The objective of determining the MTD is to be able to find the minimum safe and biologically effective dose to be the recommended Phase 2 dose. For both the sub-studies safety, efficacy and assessment of PK/PD will be used to inform the recommended phase 2 dose.\n\nArms/Groups are detailed in the 'Arms/Groups' module of this record. Dose-escalation for each substudy is as follows:\n\nSubstudy 1 (Danvatirsen Monotherapy): The maximum number of patients to be enrolled in dose-escalation phase for Danvatirsen monotherapy is 12, and patients will be treated in cohorts of 3. Based upon study parameters for Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design with a target Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) rate of 25%, if the observed DLT rate at the current dose \u2264 0.197, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose. If it is \\> 0.298, dosing will be de-escalated to the next lower dose level. Otherwise the next cohort of patients will be enrolled at the current dose. Dose escalation will discontinue and the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined: (1) once all patients have been enrolled, (2) 6 patients have been treated at the same dose level with the decision to stay, or (3) all doses are found to be too toxic. Patients not evaluable for Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be replaced. The total duration of 1 cycle is approximately 4 weeks (28 days).\n\nSubstudy 2 (Danvatirsen + Venetoclax Combination): Dose escalation for the combination therapy is as described above for the Danvatirsen monotherapy except that dose escalation will discontinue and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined: (1) once all patients have been enrolled, (2) 9 patients have been treated at the same dose level with the decision to stay, or (3) all doses are found to be too toxic. The total duration of 1 cycle is again approximately 4 weeks (28 days).\n\nDose Modifications (referenced in 'Arms/Groups'):\n\nDose modification guidelines apply to both sub-studies and are minimal recommendations. Further reductions are permitted based on PI's clinical judgment following Sponsor approval.\n\nIn general, in the event of \u2265 Grade 3 hematological toxicities, laboratory values should be monitored weekly (or more frequently until \u2264 Grade 2).\n\nProposed dose modifications for treatment related toxicity (hematological) Worst Toxicity (CTCAE V5.0 Grade Recommended Dose Modification) Thrombocytopenia: Grade 4 (Platelet \\< 25,000/mm3) Dose delay until resolved to \u2264 Grade 2\n\n* If resolved to \u2264 Grade 2 in \u2264 7 days, then maintain dose level\n* If resolved to \u2264 Grade 2 in \\> 7 but \u2264 21 days, then lower 1 dose level\n* Permanently discontinue treatment if not resolved to \u2264 Grade 3 in 21 days.\n\nProposed dose modifications for treatment related toxicity (non-hematological) Worst Toxicity (CTCAE V5.0 Grade Recommended Dose Modification) Grade 2: Dose delay until \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline and maintain dose level Grade 3: Dose delay until resolved to \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline\n\n* If resolved in \u2264 7 days, then maintain dose level\n* If resolved in \\> 7 days but \u2264 14 days, then lower 1 dose level\n* If not resolved in \u2264 14 days, then permanently discontinue treatment Grade 4 : permanently discontinue treatment\n\nDanvatirsen dose reductions Dose reduction for toxicity is allowed to one dose level below the current level. For the lowest dose of 1 mg/kg, dose reduction is allowed to 0.5 mg/kg below that dose level. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient due to toxicity, this dose should be administered for all subsequent infusions, unless a further dose reduction is required. Any subsequent dose re-escalation would require consultation with the PI. Up to 1 dose level reduction is permitted.\n\nVenetoclax Dose Modifications:\n\nDuring cycle 1, venetoclax will be dose escalated daily to the goal dose. Patients will receive 100mg on Day 1, 200mg on Day 2 and 400mg on Day 3 and onwards, or adjusted dose per venetoclax label if on concomitant azoles. The goal is to administer 28 days of venetoclax in cycle 1 unless marrow remission with concomitant marrow hypocellularity and/or myelosuppression is confirmed earlier than cycle 1 Day 28. In this case the venetoclax may be stopped earlier to avoid venetoclax related myelosuppression or further marrow hypo/aplasia after discussion and approval from the PI.\n\nInitial response assessment will occur after 21 days of study therapy. Participants with stable or responding disease may continue on study until completion of study if their treating physician and PI feel that they are deriving clinical benefit. Participants with significant AEs or progressive disease or those having absence of clinical benefit after 6 cycles of treatment should be removed from study. Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of significant adverse events, treatment may continue indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:\n\n* Disease progression\n* Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment\n* Unacceptable adverse event(s)\n* Participant decides to withdraw from the study OR\n* General or specific changes in the participant's condition or compliance render the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n\nAll participants should undergo response evaluations between Day 21 and Day 42 of first and/or second induction course (optional). Unless there is clear evidence of progressive disease in the blood, bone marrow aspiration is required and bone marrow biopsy is strongly encouraged. In cases with hypocellular marrows (\\<10% cellularity), repeat bone marrow examinations should be considered when there is evidence of hematopoietic recovery. If multiple bone marrow examinations are performed, the last examination will be used to classify the patient's response. The final response will be determined no later than day 42 from the start of therapy. Clinical BMA should be repeated to assess response prior to cycles 3, 5 and 7 and subsequently after every 2 cycles of treatment and at the end of treatment for patients that initially responded\n\nDuring treatment, all participants should undergo response evaluations prior to cycle 3. Unless there is clear evidence of progressive disease in the blood, bone marrow aspiration (BMA) is required and bone marrow biopsy is strongly encouraged. In cases with hypocellular marrows (\\<10 % cellularity), repeat bone marrow examinations should be considered when there is evidence of hematopoietic recovery. If multiple bone marrow examinations are performed, the last examination will be used to classify the patient's response. The final response will be determined no later than day 42 from the start of the first cycle of therapy. Clinical BMA should be repeated to assess response prior to cycles 3, 5 and 7 and subsequently after every 2 cycles of treatment and at the end of treatment for patients that initially responded.\n\nWhen a participant discontinues the study, a final visit will be conducted. Following discontinuation of the study treatment, the participant will be treated according to the investigator's or treating physician's discretion. After the end-of-therapy visit, patients who have not progressed/relapsed or initiated subsequent anticancer therapy will be followed every 3 months for response assessment for up to 3 years, until the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, or until disease progression/relapse, whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed to document the start of subsequent anticancer therapy and overall survival (OS) every 3 months for up to 3 years after discontinuation of study drug. If a participant discontinues from the study due to an adverse event considered related to study treatment, a follow-up visit should be conducted no later than 30 days after the last dose of protocol therapy. Safety assessments are recommended at least every 14 days, until all toxicities resolve, return to baseline or become clinically satisfactory, stable, or are considered irreversible."
