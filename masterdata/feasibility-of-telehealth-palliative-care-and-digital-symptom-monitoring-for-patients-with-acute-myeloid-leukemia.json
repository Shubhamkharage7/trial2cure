            "briefSummary": "AML is the most common leukemia diagnosed in adults. In spite of recent low-intensity therapies that have improved outcomes for older AML patients, AML remains associated with poor prognosis as well as high symptom burden. While the benefits of early palliative care as well as electronic PROs have been well-described in the oncology population, neither have been well-studied in the AML population, and have never been studied in combination. We propose a prospective, single-center, single-arm trial to evaluate the feasibility of a virtually-mediated supportive care model utilizing both electronic PROs and palliative care for patients with AML being treated with low-intensity therapy.\n\nAIM1: is to evaluate and describe the feasibility of implementing early specialty palliative care referrals carried out via telehealth/video-based modalities in combination with digital symptom monitoring for patients recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and starting low intensity induction therapy.\n\nAIM2: study the differences in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) metrics using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients recently diagnosed with AML and starting low intensity induction therapy who receive early referral to telehealth/video-based palliative care visits compared to standard care.\n\nAIM3: to explore the patient experience of patients with AML on low-intensity therapy, capture rates of advance care planning, hospice utilization, and hospital utilization."
