We hypothesize that T300+D will be safe and tolerated in CP-B patients with HCC. HCC mostly affects disadvantaged populations with higher rates among racial/ethnic minorities, who are often not included in clinical trials (i.e., Hispanics, Blacks, underserved, low socioeconomic status) and present with more severe disease. Given there is not much data in the US patient cohort, this study provides a chance to gain that knowledge.",

Patients will stay on study treatment until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.\n\nAll eligible patients who consent to this study must have a baseline evaluation (CT or MRI) within 28 days of the start of treatment.\n\nFollow-up: A repeat CT/MRI scan will be performed after 2 cycles of treatment regimen to evaluate response based on RECIST 1.1 criteria (See Appendix for definitions of response).12 Serum tumor marker AFP (every cycle) and CT/MRI scans will be repeated at least every 2 cycles, or 8 weeks, to ensure no progression of disease. Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by the patient, or decision of physician for patient's best interest. Each patient will be followed for survival for up to one year."
