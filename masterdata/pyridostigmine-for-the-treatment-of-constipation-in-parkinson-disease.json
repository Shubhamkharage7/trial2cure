            "briefSummary": "Constipation is a common and debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson disease (PD) that often precedes the onset of classic motor symptoms by decades. There is no standardized algorithm for managing constipation in this patient population, nor are there dedicated treatments. Studies suggest that constipation can affect quality of life to a significant degree, in many cases just as much as motor symptoms. There is an unmet need for effective treatment options for constipation in this patient population. The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pyridostigmine as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with PD.",
