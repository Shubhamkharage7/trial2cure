Subjects will be followed post-operatively through discharge and at 30 days (+/-14 days) post-surgery.\n\nAt least thirty-five pediatric subjects with an appropriate mild or moderate bleeding target bleeding site (TBS) will be enrolled in this study. The age of the subjects enrolled in the study will be from 1 month to less than (\\<) 18 years. This will include a minimum of 4 subjects aged 1 month (greater than or equal to \\[\\>=\\] 28 days from birth) to \\<1 year."

In addition, assent must be obtained from pediatric subjects who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the trial.

Ability to firmly press trial treatment at TBS until 4 minutes after TBS identification.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the study product or is unwilling to receive blood products;\n2.

Subject is currently participating or plan to participate in any other investigational device or drug study without prior approval from the Sponsor;\n4. Subjects who are known, current alcohol and/or drug abusers\n5. Subjects admitted for trauma surgery\n6. Subjects with any pre or intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude conduct of the study procedure\n7.
