Identification of women with above-average risk for breast cancer by MammoScreen integrated with the electronic health record (EHR).\n\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES:\n\nI. Rates of mammography screening referral. II. Screening completed and mammography results stratified by risk category. III. Among those who meet criteria, genetic counseling referral, visit completed and genetic test done.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nCLINICAL STAFF: During development some clinical team members will participate in usability testing (up to 30 minutes) of the electronic health record interface with MammoScreen. Some participants will undergo training sessions of about 20 minutes, then participate in interviews lasting up to 30 minutes at baseline prior to MammoScreen launch. Clinical staff also participate in interviews up to 30 minutes after MammoScreen launch during years 2-4. Participants complete surveys during the maintenance phase about six months after the last reminders are sent.\n\nPATIENTS: Patients participate in interviews lasting up to 1 hour. Patients medical records are reviewed. Patients will be invited via MyChart to use the MammoScreen. Reminders will be sent via MyChart to non-respondents at 2 and 4 weeks. Patients will use MammoScreen one time right after enrollment. Some patients may also participate in interviews up to 1 hour each during years 3-5."
