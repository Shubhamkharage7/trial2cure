            "briefSummary": "Gastrointestinal cancers such as colon cancer and liver cancer cause many deaths in the US. Testing could catch these cancers early, helping people live longer. The goal of this study is to compare two different ways of getting more people tested for these cancers: 1) by directly reaching out to the people who need testing or 2) by helping providers fix issues that hold up testing.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is: how should healthcare systems go about choosing one or the other?\n\nResearchers will look at cancer testing rates over time at sites that are trying these different approaches. They will also survey and interview participants from these sites.",
            "detailedDescription": "Researchers will conduct two hybrid type 3, cluster-randomized trials to compare the effectiveness of Patient Navigation (PN) and Implementation Facilitation (IF) on hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completion. Trials will enroll 24 sites for the HCC arm and 32 sites for the CRC arm, passively enrolling and cluster-randomizing Veterans by their site of primary care. Multi-level implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators), preconditions, and moderators will also be evaluated pre- and post-intervention, using Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)-mapped surveys and interviews of Veteran participants and provider participants. Comparing findings in the two trials will allow researchers to understand how the barriers and strategies operate differently for a one-time screening in a relatively healthy population (CRC) vs. repeated screening in a more medically complex population (HCC)."
