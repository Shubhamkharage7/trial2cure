Define changes in the TCR clonotypes, phenotypes, and inflammatory cytokine levels in biopsy specimens, peripheral blood leukocytes, and serum. Correlate changes in anti-tumor immune responses with clinic-pathological variables and patient outcomes."

Non-sterilized male partners of a female participants of childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female participants should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period. Highly effective contraceptive methods:\n\n   * Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\n\n     * oral\n     * intravaginal\n     * transdermal\n   * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\n\n     * oral\n     * injectable\n   * Implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation b\n   * Intrauterine device (IUD)c\n   * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)c\n   * Bilateral tubal occlusion\n   * Surgical Sterilization\n6.
