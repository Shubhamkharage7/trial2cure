            "briefSummary": "The subject has a type of cancer or lymph gland disease associated with a virus called Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), which has come back, is at risk of coming back, or has not gone away after standard treatments. This research study uses special immune system cells called LMP, BARF-1 and EBNA1- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (MABEL CTLs).\n\nSome patients with Lymphoma (such as Hodgkin (HD) or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)), T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, or CAEBV, or solid tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), smooth muscle tumors, and leiomyosarcomas show signs of a virus called EBV before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (\"mono\" or the \"kissing disease\"). EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with HD and NHL, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some immune system cells (in CAEBV) infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. EBV is also found in the majority of NPC and smooth muscle tumors, and some leiomyosarcomas. We want to see if special white blood cells (MABEL CTLs) that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in your blood and affect the tumor.\n\nIn previous studies, EBV CTLs were generated from the blood of the patient, which was often difficult if the patient had recently received chemotherapy. Also, it took up to 1-2 months to make the cells, which is not practical when a patient needs more urgent treatment. To address these issues, the MABEL CTLs were made in the lab in a simpler, faster, and safer way. The MABEL CTLs will still see LMP proteins but also two other EBV proteins called EBNA-1 and BARF. To ensure these cells are available for use in patients in urgent clinical need, we have generated MABEL CTLs from the blood of healthy donors and created a bank of these cells, which are frozen until ready for use. We have previously successfully used frozen T cells from healthy donors to treat EBV lymphoma and virus infections and we now have improved our production method to make it faster.\n\nIn this study, we want to find out if we can use banked MABEL CTLs to treat HD, NHL, T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, CAEBV, NPC, smooth muscle tumors or leiomyosarcoma. We will search the bank to find a MABEL CTL line that is a partial match with the subject.\n\nMABEL CTLs are investigational and not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
            "detailedDescription": "A healthy donor has given blood to make LMP/BARF1/EBNA-1 MABEL CTLs in the lab. We made the cells by first growing a special type of cells called activated T cells to stimulate the T cells. We then added specially produced mixtures of proteins that include the LMP, EBNA1 and BARF proteins. These were used to stimulate T cells. As the T cells grew, we added some of the healthy donor cells expressing these proteins to stimulate them. We also added a cell called K562 that has had new genes put inside it so it expresses proteins that stimulate the immune system to encourage the T cells to grow. K562 cells are cancer cells that have been treated with radiation so they cannot grow. This stimulation trained the MABEL CTLs to kill cells with EBV proteins on their surface. These cells were grown and frozen.\n\nFor the subject's treatment, the MABEL CTLs will be thawed and infused into the subject over 1-10 minutes. Initially, two doses of MABEL CTLs will be given two weeks apart. Subjects may be eligible to receive additional doses of the MABEL CTLs up to 6 times.\n\nAll of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nMedical tests before treatment:\n\nBefore being treated, the subject will receive a series of standard medical tests:\n\nPhysical exam; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Tumor measurements by routine imaging studies: Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT); Pregnancy test for females who are able to have children.\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, if the patient's level of circulating T cells is relatively high, s/he may require treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine before s/he receives MABEL CTLs.\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment:\n\nBlood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Imaging study 8 weeks after the 1st CTL infusion. If the subject receives additional doses they will also have an imaging study at 1 to 3 months after their final dose.\n\nSubjects will either be seen in the clinic or will be contacted by research staff yearly for 5 years."
