Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as repeated elevations of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2265 100 mmHg despite adequate treatment.\n9. Prior history of malignancies, other than MDS, unless the subject has been free of the disease (including completion of any active or adjuvant treatment for prior malignancy) for \u2265 1 year.
