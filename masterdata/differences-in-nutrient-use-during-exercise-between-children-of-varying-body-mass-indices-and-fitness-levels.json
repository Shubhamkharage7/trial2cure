Up to 80 children will be recruited to participate in this study at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center (ACNC).\n\nThey will be asked to attend three study visits (baseline, and two exercise visits). For the exercise visits, they will follow a diet plan and be encouraged to avoid certain foods and activities.\n\nChildren will do two testing days with the following measures:\n\n* Urine (pee) will be collected\n* Body weight and height\n* Exercise test on the bike - children will ride a stationary bike at a set intensity and at an intensity relative to their previous bike test during the study \"MI Energy\". The order in which they bike will be random. Before and during biking, children will wear a mask that will measure the gases in their breath and a monitor that will measure heart rate."
