This study is for individuals who have been diagnosed with advanced, high-risk prostate cancer and standard therapies available to treat your disease have not been effective. Participation in this research will last about 3 years and 9 months.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of combining two study drugs (relacorilant and enzalutamide) with hormone therapy. Doctors leading this study hope to learn if combining these study drugs with hormone therapy is safe and could improve the results of surgery and delay the time to when prostate cancer tumors spread to other parts of the body in individuals with advanced, high-risk prostate cancer who plan to receive a radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the whole prostate and surrounding tissue).\n\nProstate cancer cells usually need hormones (called androgens) to grow. One of these hormones is testosterone, which is mostly produced in the testicles. The usual approach for treating prostate cancer after it progresses involves taking medications to decrease or block the development of hormones (including testosterone) so that prostate cancer cells can't continue to grow. This approach is called androgen deprivation therapy (hormone therapy). Enzalutamide is a hormone-blocking medication, which is a standard of care for prostate cancer when it spreads (metastasizes)."
