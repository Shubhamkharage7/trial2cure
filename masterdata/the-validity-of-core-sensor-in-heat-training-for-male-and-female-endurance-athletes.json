Additionally, repeated mild to moderate heat stress, heat acclimation, can be used to improve exercise tolerance and performance. Thus, an athlete can gain performance benefits through monitoring their heat loading while training. The aim of this study is to compare the CORE\u2122 body temperatures recorded during exercise in two different environmental conditions in which the investigators will get a separation of core temperature and skin temperature. The investigators will accomplish this by recruiting trained and elite athletes, ages 18-59, to participate in two exercise sessions in the heat at low (10-20%) and high (80-100%) relative humidity. The investigators will compare the CORE\u2122 temperature estimates against an FDA approved ingestible temperature monitoring device to assess the accuracy of the CORE\u2122 devices."
