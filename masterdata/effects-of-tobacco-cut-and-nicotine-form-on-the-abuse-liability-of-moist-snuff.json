            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the effects of tobacco cut and nicotine form on the abuse liability in participants who use moist snuff (smokeless tobacco \\[SLT\\]). Two features of moist snuff that are key targets of manipulation from the tobacco industry and drivers of its addiction potential are length of tobacco cut (long versus fine) and nicotine form (low versus high levels of nicotine in the free-base form). Finer tobacco cuts and higher levels of free-base nicotine (FBN) result in faster, greater nicotine delivery. Researchers want to gain information on how certain characteristics of moist snuff affect how long people use it, how it delivers nicotine, or how much people like it. This clinical trial may provide justifications for local, state, or federal regulations aimed at reducing the appeal and addictiveness of moist snuff.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the association between style of moist snuff and SLT addiction among Ohio Appalachian adolescents and adults.\n\nII. Characterize the carcinogen and free-base nicotine content of SLT products used by adolescents and adults with varying levels of SLT dependence in Ohio Appalachia.\n\nIII. Assess effects of moist snuff tobacco cut and FBN content on product use, effects, and appeal among Appalachian adults with high versus (vs.) low SLT dependence.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants attend 5 study visits in a randomized order.\n\nVISIT I: Participants use their usual brand of moist snuff on study. Participants also undergo blood sample collection and carbon monoxide testing on study.\n\nVISIT II: Participants use low FBN long cut moist snuff on study. Participants also undergo blood sample collection and carbon monoxide testing on study.\n\nVISIT III: Participants use low FBN fine cut moist snuff on study. Participants also undergo blood sample collection and carbon monoxide testing on study.\n\nVISIT IV: Participants use high FBN long cut moist snuff on study. Participants also undergo blood sample collection and carbon monoxide testing on study.\n\nVISIT V: Participants use high FBN fine cut moist snuff on study. Participants also undergo blood sample collection and carbon monoxide testing on study."
