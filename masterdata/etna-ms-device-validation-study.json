Effectiveness of the device will be assessed by the level of agreement between the EDSS estimated by the device and the actual scores measured by the neurologist in-person assessments.",

Eligible patients with MS will be selected and categorized based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Patients eye movements will be captured using the patented eye-tracking technology at one single time point. In addition to the eye-tracking tests, patient phenotypes will be further detailed via brief functional and cognitive assessments using the EDSS, Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). All patients will be required to participate in a single session."
