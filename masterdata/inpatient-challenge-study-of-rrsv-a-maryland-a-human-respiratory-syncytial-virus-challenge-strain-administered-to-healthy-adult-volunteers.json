            "detailedDescription": "This study will evaluate the safety, infectivity and replication, and immunogenicity of a recombinant respiratory syncytial virus (rRSV A/Maryland/001/11) challenge virus administered intranasally to healthy adults.\n\nParticipants will be admitted to the inpatient isolation unit and will receive a single dose of 10\\^5 plaque forming units (PFUs) of rRSV A/Maryland/001/11, delivered intranasally on Day 0. Participants will be enrolled outside of the RSV season between April 1 and October 31.\n\nParticipants will remain in the inpatient isolation unit for a minimum of 8 days after the challenge and will be discharged after two RSV reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results lower than 3 Log10 genome equivalents per mL of nasal wash.\n\nUpon discharge from the inpatient unit, participants will attend outpatient visits on Days 10 (if previously discharged), 28, and 56. These study visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, and nasal washes. At 6 months, there will be a follow-up phone contact to assess for any new chronic conditions or serious health events/hospitalizations.\n\nVolunteers in Cohort 1 received a dose of 10\\^5 PFU, consistent with similar RSV challenge studies done previously. Cohort 2 will be conducted as an extension of Cohort 1 to extend the safety and infectivity evaluation, and will also receive a single dose of 10\\^5 PFU rRSV A/Maryland/001/11 challenge."
