            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies how well an exercise program (Totally Excited About Moving, Mobility, and Exercise \\[TEAM Me\\]) affects the exercise and dietary habits of pediatric and adolescents and young adults with cancer undergoing a blood stem cell transplant. TEAM Me is an exercise program that reinforces behavior, such as walking and other activities, using \"tokens\" (i.e. stickers) that can be redeemed for rewards. Participating in the exercise program may result in increased physical fitness, physical activity level, quality of life, and function in pediatric and adolescents and young adult patients with cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of this exercise program using a token economy system in hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of an exercise program using a token economy system in hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients going through HSCT on measures of physical fitness.\n\nII. To evaluate the impact of an exercise program using a token economy system in hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients going through HSCT on physical activity.\n\nIII. To evaluate the impact of an exercise program using a token economy system in hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients on quality of life, fatigue, sleep and function.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients complete a 6-minute walk test and a timed get up and go test on the day of hospital admission, on days 0 (day of stem cell transplant) and 21, the day of discharge, and day 100. Patients also complete surveys over 10 minutes about quality of life and fatigue levels on the day of hospital admission, on days 0 (day of stem cell transplant) and 21, the day of discharge, and day 100. Patients who are able and allowed to, may also walk and participate in other intense physical activities to earn stickers. Patients who are unable to walk have tailored goals created by a physical/occupational therapist to earn stickers and participate in physical activity as prescribed by their therapist."
