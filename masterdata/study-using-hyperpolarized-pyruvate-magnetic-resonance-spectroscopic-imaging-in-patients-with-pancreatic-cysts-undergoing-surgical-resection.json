            "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives:\n\nTo explore the use of HP-MR in patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas undergoing surgical resection. Patients will undergo HP-MR prior to surgical resection (or cyst wall biopsy) and kpl values will be determined to evaluate metabolic activity. Pathology will then determine whether the cyst was of benign/low risk or malignant/high risk nature. The ability for increased kpl to detect an invasive carcinoma will be explored by estimating the association between lesions' kpl values and lesions' pathological results.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* A kpl inflection point, or threshold, will then be explored to estimate the association with malignant/high risk cyst. This threshold value would then undergo further validation in future studies to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of this value.\n* Correlate HP-MR findings to tissue metabolomics (ex vivo): In all patients who undergo surgical resection, a small surgical sample will be supplied for ex vivo metabolomics. NMR metabolomics will be used to measure lactate, creatine, choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, and alanine within the tissue sample. The highest lactate levels should be found in the most aggressive tumors, which also should correlate to high kpl.\n* Correlate HP-MR findings to blood and cyst fluid biomarkers: Blood samples taken prior to surgical resection will be analyzed for CA19-9 and CEA. If the patient has a cystic fluid aspiration prior to surgical resection, then CA19-9, amylase and CEA will also be measured in these samples. These biomarkers will be compared to findings from HP-MR and pathologic results.\n* Correlate HP-MR findings to immunohistochemical staining for LDH-A and HIF-1\u03b1: Tissue taken from pathology samples for metabolomics will also undergo immunohistochemical staining for LDH-A and HIF-1\u03b1.\n* Correlate gut and tissue microbiome with HP-MR findings: Microbiome studies may be performed under the auspice of another protocol but could be analyzed under this protocol in relation to HP-MR findings. PA 16-0911 allows for the collection of stool in patients with cysts of the pancreas for gut microbiome investigation in relation to the development of pancreatic cancer.\n* To explore the safety and tolerability of HP-MR in patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas undergoing surgical resection or cyst wall biopsy."
