            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label Phase I/Ib dose-escalation, dose-expansion clinical trial of the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of ProAgio combined with gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel (G-nP) in previously untreated subjects with metastatic PDAC. The study will use an EWOC design in Phase I to determine the recommended RP2D of ProAgio with gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel (G-nP). After the estimation of RP2D of ProAgio alone, the trial will continue to estimate the RP2D of ProAgio when combined with G-nP, starting from 2 dose levels lower than the estimated RP2D of ProAgio alone. EWOC design will enroll 2 subjects per cohort with 4 combination dose levels.\n\nSubjects will be selected based on following criteria: previously untreated advanced PDAC, ECOG performance status (0-1), and adequate organ functions. Subjects with recent surgeries, history of recent thromboembolic events or significant cardiovascular disease will be excluded.\n\nOnce the MTD and RP2D of ProAgio with G-nP RP2D have been identified, an expansion cohort of 12 subjects with metastatic PDAC (n=6 receiving ProAgio and n=6 receiving ProAgio + GnP) will begin. The purpose of the expansion cohort is to confirm the safety of the regimen and provide preliminary data on the activity of both ProAgio monotherapy and ProAgio + GnP.\n\nData regarding adverse events will be collected, attributed and graded according to NCICTCAE criteria. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will be collected per the study flow chart. Response will be evaluated every 2 months using RECIST criteria. Planned secondary analyses will include ORR, duration of response, PFS and OS."

Use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (eg, G-CSF, GMCSF, M-CSF), thrombopoietin mimetics or erythroid stimulating agents \u2264 2 weeks prior start of study treatment. If erythroid stimulating agents were initiated more than 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and the patient is on a stable dose, they can be maintained.\n5. Active unstable autoimmune disease. Documented history of autoimmune disease that is well controlled on stable immune suppressive therapy can be enrolled after discussion with principal investigator.\n6. Allogenic bone marrow or solid organ transplant.\n7. Known history or current interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis.\n8.

Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: malignancies that were treated curatively and have not recurred within 2 years prior to study treatment; completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and any completely resected carcinoma in situ.\n9. Clinically significant infection, including known HIV or hepatitis C infection, or known hepatitis B surface antigen positivity. Testing of asymptomatic patients will not be required.\n10.
