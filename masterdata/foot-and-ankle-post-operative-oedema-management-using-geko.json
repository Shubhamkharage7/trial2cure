The study patient population will be randomised on a 1:1 basis into two groups of 61 patients each. These groups are defined as Group A patients who receive geko\u2122 therapy and SC i.e. the intervention group and Group B patients who receive Standard Care (SC) only i.e. no intervention. The participants will be assessed pre-surgery and up to 90 days post-surgery."
