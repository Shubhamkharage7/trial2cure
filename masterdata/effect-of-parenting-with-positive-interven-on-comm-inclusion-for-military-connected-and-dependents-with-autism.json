            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to find out if a training program for parents with military dependent or connected children with autism (ASD) who have challenging behavior will help those children and their families participate in more community activities. The training program, called Parenting with Positive Behavior Interventions, may help military parents learn new tools that will help their children with autism and challenging behavior attend community activities more easily.",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to either immediately receive the Parenting with Positive Behavior Interventions or you will be asked to wait in a control condition for six months and then receive the same intervention. Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups (get the treatment immediately or wait 6 months) but will be given a chance to receive the intervention regardless within 6 months.\n\nIn this study, participants will be asked to do the following things:\n\n1. Attend (virtually or in-person) a one-hour monthly training about behavior interventions for children with autism.\n2. Participate in two 60- minutes sessions with a behavior coach (virtually or in-person) each month to talk about a community goal they want to complete with their child.\n3. Attend an optional 60-minute meeting with other research participates each month to talk about their experience learning how to manage their child's behavior.\n4. Work with a researcher to fill out a series of questionnaires 3 times during the study. These questionnaires will ask about participants, their child's challenging behaviors, stress related to community activities with their child, and how often they participate in community activities with their child with autism and challenging behavior."
