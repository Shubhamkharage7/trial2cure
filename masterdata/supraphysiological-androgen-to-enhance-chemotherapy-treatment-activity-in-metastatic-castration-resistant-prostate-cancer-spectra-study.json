            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well giving testosterone at levels higher than normally found in the body (supraphysiological) works to enhance chemotherapy treatment in patients with prostate cancer that has progressed despite being previously treated with androgen therapies and has spread from where it first started (prostate) to other places in the body (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer). In patients that have developed progressive cancer in spite of standard hormonal treatment, administering supraphysiological testosterone may result in regression of tumors by causing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in tumor cells that have adapted to low testosterone conditions. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill tumor cells. Giving supraphysiological levels of testosterone and carboplatin or etoposide together may be an effective treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patients are then assigned to 1 of 3 sub-cohorts within cohort I.\n\nCOHORT Ia: Patients continue to receive ADT and receive testosterone cypionate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 of cycle 1. Patients then receive testosterone cypionate IM and carboplatin intravenously (IV) on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT Ib: Patients continue to receive ADT and receive carboplatin IV on day 1 of cycle 1. Patients then receive testosterone cypionate IM and carboplatin IV on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT Ic: Patients continue to receive ADT and receive testosterone cypionate IM and carboplatin IV on day 1 of cycle 1. Patients then receive testosterone cypionate IM and carboplatin IV on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients are then assigned to 1 of 3 sub-cohorts within cohort II.\n\nCOHORT IIa: Patients continue to receive ADT and receive testosterone cypionate IM on day 1 of cycle 1. Patients then receive testosterone cypionate IM on day 1 and etoposide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT IIb: Patients continue to receive ADT and receive etoposide PO QD on days 1-14 of cycle 1. Patients then receive testosterone cypionate IM on day 1 and etoposide PO QD on days 1-14 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT IIc: Patients continue to receive ADT and receive testosterone cypionate IM on day 1 and etoposide PO QD on days 1-14 of cycle 1. Patients then receive testosterone cypionate IM on day 1 and etoposide PO QD on days 1-14 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAll patients undergo a biopsy on study and blood sample collection on study, and bone scans and computed tomography (CT) scans throughout the trial. Patients may also undergo an optional second biopsy at the end of study treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 6 months for 2 years."
