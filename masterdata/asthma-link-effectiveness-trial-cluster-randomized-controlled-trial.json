            "briefSummary": "The goal of this cluster RCT is to determine the effectiveness of Asthma Link, a school supervised asthma therapy program, compared with an educational asthma workbook, in improving asthma symptoms for children with poorly controlled asthma aged 5-14.",
            "detailedDescription": "Asthma is an extremely common chronic disease in childhood with significant morbidity. The majority of asthma morbidity in children is due to medication non-adherence, and both morbidity and medication non-adherence disproportionately impact minoritized children. School-supervised asthma therapy ensures that children receive their preventive asthma medication daily at school and has shown efficacy in improving medication adherence and asthma health outcomes, particularly in low-income and racial/ethnic minority children. However, this strategy has not been widely adopted in practice to produce meaningful public health impact. To address this gap, our team developed a new model, Asthma Link, which partners pediatric practices, schools, and families to deliver school-supervised asthma therapy. This intervention leverages established infrastructure and requires minimal resources to operate, enhancing sustainability in a real-world setting. Our pilot trial of Asthma Link showed improved asthma symptoms when compared to an enhanced usual care condition, particularly among low-income, Black and Latino children, and demonstrated trial feasibility. Moreover, we have rigorously adapted this intervention for real-world use using input from diverse, multi-level community stakeholders.\n\nThis 14 site cluster randomized controlled trial will determine the effectiveness of Asthma Link versus an enhanced usual care condition in improving asthma health outcomes in school-aged children with poorly controlled asthma.\n\nOur central hypothesis is that children in Asthma Link will have higher Asthma Control Test scores at 6 months compared with children in enhanced usual care; with maintained improvements at 12 months. Our secondary hypothesis is that children in Asthma Link will have higher inhaled corticosteroid adherence and quality of life scores, and lower rates of asthma exacerbations, school absences and parental lost workdays compared with children in the enhanced usual care condition."
