            "detailedDescription": "Osteoarthritis is estimated to affect at least 10% of men and 13% of women over 60 years old in the United States. It's estimated roughly 1 million total joint replacements are being performed each year. Studies have suggested that for patients with knee pain that have high BMIs, low strength, and/or have not participated in conservative measures, a low-impact exercise plan when paired with diet counseling and behavioral health classes can improve patient reported outcomes scores in both pain and function. This study seeks to build upon this research and will provide low-impact exercise plans that will be paired with standard of care dietician and behavioral health interventions in order to offer patients a full-scope approach to battling osteoarthritis pain, especially for those with high BMIs, low strength, and/or for patients that have not attempted conservative therapy in the past. We will include patients with knee, hip, and ankle pain."
