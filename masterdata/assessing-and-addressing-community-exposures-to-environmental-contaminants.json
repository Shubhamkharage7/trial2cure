Furthermore, assessing the extent of environmental contamination, individual toxicant burdens and micronutrient levels and health disorders in Ramapough Tribal members of both sexes as outlined in the following:\n\n* Collect in-person/online survey information on demographics, health and food intake, nutrition, food security, and psychosocial stressors, and perform core anthropometric measurements (i.e., height, weight, body mass index, body circumference and blood pressure) at enrollment on Tribal members to inform health promotion strategies and community actions.\n* Determine individual-level contaminant burdens and micronutrient concentrations (e.g., iron, calcium, folate, vitamins) in urine and blood from surveyed (sub-aim 1a) Ramapough Turtle Clan volunteers.\n* Test soil, plants and surface water where Turtle Clan residents live, recreate and attend church in Ringwood, NJ using a community-based, citizen scientist approach."
