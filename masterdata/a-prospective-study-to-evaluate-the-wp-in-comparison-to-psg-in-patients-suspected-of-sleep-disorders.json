For that purpose, the WP with finger probe and chest sensor will be worn by the subject simultaneous to PSG in a sleep study at the clinical sleep lab. A PSG system will be recording the PSG data.",

Additionally, patients with comorbidities associated with central sleep apnea may be referred from cardiology related divisions, and screened for participation in the study. Recruited patients will be asked to sign an informed consent form. Subject demographic and medical information will be acquired from the subject himself and/or from the subject's medical chart and will be recorded on the appropriate case report forms.\n\nThe subjects will be admitted to the clinical sleep laboratory for one night, during which they will undergo conventional full night PSG recording with the standard PSG channels. The WP with finger probe and chest sensor will be worn by the subject simultaneous to PSG. A PSG system will be recording the signals and manual scoring will be performed blinded - without access to WP data. The WP analysis will be done automatically."
