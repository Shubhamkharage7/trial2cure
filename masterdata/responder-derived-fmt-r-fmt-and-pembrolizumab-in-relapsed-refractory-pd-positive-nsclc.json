Patients with anti-PD-1 R/R NSCLC are eligible to enroll. Prior exposure to microbiome modulating therapy is exclusionary. Suitable patients will be identified at the time of progression upon PD-1 monotherapy or PD-1 containing regimens. Patients will undergo a 35-day screening evaluation consisting of systemic staging scans, tumor biopsy, stool/blood serologic studies to confirm suitability.\n\nOnce enrolled, patients will be seromatched with a suitable donor. Suitable donors are advanced cancer patients who have undergone PD-1 monotherapy and are currently in durable remission (median PFS \\>24 months from initiation of PD-1 therapy) with no ongoing irAE as delineated below. Patients will receive R-FMT (induction) via colonoscopy on C1D1 and C3D1. R-FMT (maintenance) via sigmoidoscopy on C4D1 and will be repeated every 9 weeks. All patients will additionally receive pembrolizumab at 200mg every three weeks. Patients will be treated until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or completion of 2 years of therapy, whichever comes first."

Patients with either squamous or non-squamous NSCLC may enroll. Documented PD-L1 status (defined as 1% or greater) as determined by immunohistochemistry with anti-PD-L1 antibody (IHC 22C3 pharmDx or other FDA approved diagnostic method) from a core or excisional biopsy (fine needle aspirate is not sufficient). Patients with small cell, large cell, neuroendocrine and/or sarcomatoid NSCLC are excluded.\n* Participants must have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD(L)1 ICI administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other standard/investigational therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all the following criteria:\n\n  * Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD(L)1 ICI administered as a single agent, in combination with chemotherapy, and/or in combination with other investigational therapy.\n  * Participants who progressed on/within 3 months of adjuvant therapy with anti-PD(L)1 ICI will eligible.\n  * Demonstrated disease progression after anti-PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no sooner than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD.\n  * Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 mAb.\n  * NOTE: Progressive disease must be determined as above.\n  * NOTE: Only patients with primary progressive disease wherein best response to anti-PD(L)1 therapy is PD or SD less than/equal to 6 months are eligible. If multiple anti-PD(L)1 lines were received, the patient is eligible if the response is similar (PD or SD less than/equal to 6 months) for all anti-PD(L)1 lines of therapy.\n  * NOTE: This determination is made by the treating investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD documentation will be considered the date of PD.\n  * NOTE: Anti-PD(L)1 ICI need not be the most recent line of therapy administered.\n* Patients with CNS disease are eligible if CNS metastases are treated and deemed stable prior to date of enrollment.\n\n  * NOTE: All patients will undergo CNS imaging at the time of Screening. Patients with treated brain metastases will need repeat CNS imaging to document stability.\n  * NOTE: Stability is defined based on appearance of treated lesions on a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI brain study performed as part of screening by radiologist, radiation oncologist or neurosurgeon (whichever is most appropriate); absence of new or enlarging brain metastases; and no longer requiring systemic steroids (\u2264 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for at least one week prior to enrollment.\n  * NOTE: The contrast-enhanced CT or MRI brain imaging study should be performed no sooner than 2 weeks after most recent surgical and/or radiological intervention.\n  * NOTE: If lesions were discovered during Screening, the patient may be eligible if the lesions are treated and stable based on the above criteria.\n  * NOTE: Patients with leptomeningeal involvement (leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI/CT imaging and/or positive CSF cytology) are excluded regardless of stability.\n* Prior treatment(s)\n\n  * NOTE: Prior anti-CTLA-4 ICI is allowed but not required.\n  * NOTE: Patients with known oncogenic driver (including but not limited to EGFR, ALK, ROS, MET alterations) must have received and progressed past driver-specific therapy.\n* Willingness to repeatedly receive FMT administered endoscopically (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) following necessary bowel preparation pre-procedure.\n\n  * NOTE: Understands infectious risks associated with FMT administration. Although FMT infusate has been screened for bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites there is a risk of transmission of known and unknown infectious organisms contained in the donor stool. Post-FMT bacteremia (e.g., E. coli), sepsis and fatal events may rarely occur.\n  * NOTE: Understands non-infectious risks associated with FMT administration. Possible allergy and/or anaphylaxis to antigens in donor stool. Theoretical risk of developing disease possibly related to donor gut microbiota including but not limited to: obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, allergic/atopic disorders, neurologic disorders, psychiatric conditions and malignancy.\n  * NOTE: Understand risks associated with endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) including risk of infection transmission, colonic perforation, aspiration pneumonia, and death.\n  * NOTE: Understand that data regarding the long-term safety risk of FMT are lacking.\n* Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Patients need to have at least one measurable lesion and a separate lesion for biopsy. Patients with only 1 lesion may be enrolled after discussion with Sponsor-Investigator. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.\n* Able to provide newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated to undergo tumor biopsy (core, punch, incisional or excisional).
