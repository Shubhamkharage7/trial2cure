No randomization will occur in this study.\n\nParticipants will complete a total of five study visits (2 Screening Visits, Initiation Visit, day 60 follow-up and day 61 follow-up). The expected duration of participation in the clinical study is up to 104 days for each subject.\n\nUp to 41 participants diagnosed with PD previously implanted with a compatible STN-DBS System will be enrolled at up to five (5) sites in the United States. A maximum of 15 subjects may be enrolled at any site."
