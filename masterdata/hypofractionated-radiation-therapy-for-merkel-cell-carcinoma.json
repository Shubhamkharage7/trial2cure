Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a fewer number of days than tradition radiation therapy courses for Merkel cell carcinoma. This may be less suppressive of the immune response to tumors and should be helpful for patient convenience.",

For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. (refer to MDA Policy CLN 1114) This includes all female patients, between the onset of menses and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which may be one of the following: \u2022 Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months). \u2022 History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. \u2022 Ovarian failure (Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Estradiol in menopausal range, who have received Whole Pelvic Radiation Therapy). \u2022 History of bilateral tubal ligation or another surgical sterilization procedure. Approved methods of birth control are as follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), Tubal Ligation or hysterectomy, Subject/Partner post vasectomy, Implantable or injectable contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of RT.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous radiation therapy to the site of planned primary or nodal radiation treatment such that the prior site of treatment would be encompassed by the radiation field needed to treat the current cancer. In other words, treatment on this trial would require re-irradiation of tissues.\n* Patients with distant metastases\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RT is a known teratogen.\n* Patients who are less than 18 years of age becase RT is extremely rare in this population and the treatment agent is a known carcinogen.",
