            "briefSummary": "The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to compare the use of a continuous infusion versus intermittent ketorolac on postoperative patients in the pediatric cardiovascular ICU. We intend to determine if the continuous infusion leads to a decreased utilization of opiates when compared to intermittent ketorolac.",
            "detailedDescription": "The mainstay of postoperative pain control in the CVICU remains opiate-based therapy. Reliance on this class of medications can be detrimental, contributing to complications including hemodynamic instability, dependency, and withdrawal which can ultimately lead to longer hospital admissions, as well as long term and persistent neurodevelopmental effects. In addition, the opioid crisis has driven practitioners to aim for methods to reduce opioid exposure and post-operative narcotic prescriptions in pediatric and adult patients alike. There is a growing body of evidence in the adult literature showing promising results with the use of a continuous infusion of ketorolac in postoperative patients, including in a pediatric population. What the current literature has failed to show is whether a continuous infusion of ketorolac post operatively decreases the use of opiate mediations in a pediatric population compared to intermittent bolus injections, which is the current standard of care. Given the sensitivity and fragility inherent in those patients with CHD, working to reduce deleterious effects from excessive and prolonged opiate exposure is imperative. This study aims to examine whether the use of a continuous infusion of ketorolac can reduce the amount of opiates needed to treat postoperative pain control in the pediatric CVICU population, in comparison to patients who receive intermittent ketorolac within the first 72 hours post-operatively."
