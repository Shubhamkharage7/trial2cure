            "briefSummary": "The study hypothesis is that cromolyn, when combined with standard COVID-19 treatment, will improve patient symptoms and reduce the number of days to improved quality of life.\n\nInvestigators will study the effects of adding cromolyn to the standard treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and who require supplemental oxygen. Cromolyn will be administered as a nebulized treatment four times a day for four days followed by intranasal administration for two weeks. Investigators may also screen for biomarkers that could indicate inflammatory responses and treatment-induced improvement.\n\nParticipants will receive either study drug or placebo which will be administered by nebulization for 4 days followed by 14 days of intranasal administration. Participants will be followed while in the hospital and then as outpatients up to day 21 following randomization.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will take place in two phases: Phase 1 will be an open label study of 10 patients who will all receive the Cromolyn nebulization treatment followed by Cromolyn nasal spray to assess tolerability and response to the study treatment. Investigators may also draw blood from 10 healthy patients who will be the controls for the cellular and cytokine assays. Phase 2 will be a randomized double blind placebo-controlled study of 50 patients randomized 1:1 to receive Cromolyn nebulization followed by Cromolyn intranasal spray vs. saline nebulization and saline intranasal spray.\n\nWhile subjects are hospitalized, investigators will record morning pulse, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Morning and daily peak oxygen supplementation as indicated by the use of high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation will be recorded. The investigators will also note any improvement or decline in participant's condition and any reduction or increase in oxygen supplementation.\n\nFollow-up phone calls (or EMR review if still hospitalized) will be made on days 7, 14, and 21 to assess dyspnea and physical function. Validated questionnaires from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) (https://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis) will be used to evaluate dyspnea and physical function. Once discharged, patients will also be asked to maintain a daily log of nasal drug use, COVID-19 symptoms, resting pulse and oxygen saturation which will be reviewed at the 21 day virtual visit."
