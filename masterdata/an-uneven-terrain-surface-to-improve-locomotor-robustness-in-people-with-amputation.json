            "briefSummary": "To attain high levels of mobility, people with lower limb amputation must build both the skill and the confidence to rely on their prosthesis in the environments that they will encounter in daily life. The purpose of this research is to determine whether practicing walking on an uneven terrain surface, specifically designed to present a modest, manageable disturbance to walking, can improve balance, locomotor flexibility (i.e. the ability to adapt walking to different walking contexts) and balance confidence, to a greater extent than walking on level ground alone. This preliminary study aims to determine whether uneven terrain walking is feasible and acceptable in the target population, and also to establish preliminary efficacy.",
            "detailedDescription": "The long-term focus of this research is to investigate an uneven terrain training paradigm as an intervention to improve locomotor skill and confidence in lower limb prosthesis users; specifically to determine whether by inducing step-to-step variability in a safe environment, through training on an uneven terrain surface, individuals may develop more adaptable gait, and greater confidence in their mobility. We hypothesize that inducing a manageable level of variability into walking patterns during training will lead to greater balance, locomotor flexibility, and balance confidence. The surface has shallow contours that alter foot-ground interactions at each step, disrupting habitual movement patterns.\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the uneven surface as a mobility training tool for lower limb prosthesis users. Ambulatory lower limb prosthesis users will attend a biomechanics laboratory on two occasions, during which they will complete walking practice sessions on a flat surface and on an uneven surface. A crossover design will be employed, with walking surface order randomized across participants. Preliminary efficacy will be established based on functional tasks and self-efficacy questions administered before and after the sessions on each day. Feasibility and acceptability will be established based on feasibility study objectives from Orsmond \\& Cohn's feasibility framework."
