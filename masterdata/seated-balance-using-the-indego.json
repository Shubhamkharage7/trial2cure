            "briefSummary": "Exoskeleton-assisted walking (EAW) provides a new mobility option and appears to have potential therapeutic benefits for persons with SCI. However, present day technology is not sufficient to replace the wheelchair. During EAW, users stand upright, maintain static and dynamic balance by actively and passively stimulating trunk and lower limb muscles in a manner not challenged during wheelchair use. Preliminary results in our laboratory suggest that the indirect balance challenges and postural perturbations that result during EAW training transfer to better seated balance control, resulting in more independence during seated activities. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effects of EAW training on various measures of seated balance (primary outcomes) and body composition (secondary outcomes). Twenty people with SCI (T4 and below) who are wheelchair users for mobility and cannot walk independently will be recruited. The participants will receive 36 sessions of EAW training in 12 weeks. The outcomes will be evaluated pre (baseline) and post (24 and 36 sessions). If EAW devices can be demonstrated to help people with SCI have better seated balance, in addition to the other potential benefits that are being investigated elsewhere, then exoskeletons may have the possibility to be more readily accepted in the clinical, home environments, and by the insurance companies.",
            "detailedDescription": "Introduction/Background: People with spinal cord injury (SCI) can lose partial to complete voluntary control of arm, trunk and leg muscles, resulting in an inability to sit with stability, stand and/or walk. Because of poor trunk control during sitting, it may be challenging to reach for objects, dress or transfer independently, and the risk of a fall from their wheelchair is increased. Exoskeleton-assisted walking (EAW) provides upright, over ground mobility and has been demonstrated to be beneficial to improve patient-reported quality of life and some health-related outcomes. However, present day exoskeletons are not ready to replace the wheelchair. Our preliminary findings suggest that while walking in an exoskeleton, people with SCI are challenged to maintain upright balance by using their trunk muscles in a way that is rarely done from a wheelchair. Stimulation of the trunk muscles from upright postural challenges during EAW appears to benefit overall seated trunk control.\n\nSummary of Goals and Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine whether EAW can improve the primary outcomes of: seated balance, seated activities of daily living, and trunk muscle use. Additional secondary outcomes for body composition will be studied. Twenty people with SCI (T4 and below) who are wheelchair users will be recruited to participate.\n\nImpact: The investigators believe that EAW training will significantly improve seated balance to improve wheelchair safety, stability and quality of life, thus, empowering people with SCI who use a wheelchair to live more independently. If EAW is demonstrated to have a significant benefit on seated balance, then use of these devices in the clinical and home environments may be further justified."
