Participants will then be asked to participate in a qualitative interview about the cognitive task tool and body sensations and emotions experienced during exercise.",

Additionally, researchers want to learn more about the physical and emotional experience of exercise from our survivors.\n\nThe plan for this study is to administer single category implicit association tests (PSC-IAT's) to participants during on campus SJLIFE testing and use this data to determine the feasibility of this tool's use in survivors of childhood cancer without cognitive impairment. This study will also administer the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2)37 to participants as a construct validity check to the PSC-IAT.\n\nThe procedures include PSC-IAT and BREQ-2 tests (before and after strenuous exercise as part of the SJLIFE protocol) and a qualitative interview. These will be in addition to standard components of the SJLIFE on-campus visit."
