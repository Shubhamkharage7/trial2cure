            "detailedDescription": "This single-center, four-arm, pilot randomized research study is to test if high-intensity exercise and high-fiber diet are feasible and effective in improving the gut microbiome health, immune function, physical fitness, treatment-related side effects, and treatment outcomes in participants with advanced melanoma receiving immunotherapy. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 4 study groups: Group A Exercise, Group B Diet, Group C Combined, and Group D Attention Control. Randomization means a participant will be placed into an intervention group by chance.\n\nThe information learned by doing this research may help determine whether participating in such lifestyle interventions are tolerable during immunotherapy and exert health benefits among melanoma participants.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study visits, stool samples, blood tests, and questionnaires.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last up to a total of 9 weeks.\n\nIt is expected about 40 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis study is sponsored by the World Cancer Research Fund International."

This study targets insufficiently active persons to assess the effect of the described exercise intervention, where additional exercise done regularly will contaminate the intervention outcomes.\n* Consuming more than 25 and 38 grams of dietary fiber per day for women and men, respectively over the past month.

Patients with unstable medical conditions may develop unexpected adverse events from exercise and dietary changes. For the purpose of patients' safety, patients with unstable medical conditions are excluded.\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study.\n* Development of second malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) that requires concurrent treatment, which would interfere with this study.",
