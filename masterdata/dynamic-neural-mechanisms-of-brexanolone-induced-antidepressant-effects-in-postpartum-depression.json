Study phases will include screening, enrollment, intervention, and follow-up. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility criteria through clinical assessments and self-report. Enrolled subjects will be admitted to the UNC Women's Hospital, where five serial EEG recordings will be obtained, along with frequent assessments of affective state, before, during, and after a 60-hour IV infusion of BRX. Follow-up procedures will include assessments of PPD and affective symptoms, as well as an exit interview with the study team. If feasibility outcomes are achieved, exploratory EEG analyses will be performed with AMICA (adaptive mixture independent component analysis), community detection, and microstate assessment. Exploratory analyses of data collected by facial expression detection software (iMotions Affectiva) are also planned."
