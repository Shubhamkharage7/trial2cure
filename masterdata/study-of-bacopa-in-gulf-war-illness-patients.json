            "briefSummary": "Gulf War Illness is a condition that affects multiple major organ systems, resulting in a diverse array of symptoms that include debilitating fatigue, memory and cognition difficulties, headaches, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, skin rashes, and musculoskeletal/joint pain. This phase II, double masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm study will evaluate cognitive function as evidence of efficacy of the nutraceutical intervention, Bacopa, on central nervous system symptom management of Gulf War Illness, along with assessments of safety of the intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a study in Gulf War Veterans born between 1946 and 1974 who meet the modified Kansas and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definitions for Gulf War Illness. This phase II, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm study will focus on assessing cognitive function as evidence of efficacy of the nutraceutical intervention, Bacopa, on central nervous system symptom management of Gulf War Illness. 264 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 12 weeks of the intervention (Bacopa) or placebo. Participants will be evaluated \"remotely\" via online assessment tools and telephone interviews, allowing participation from a nationwide catchment area. Primary assessment via the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II) will occur at baseline and 12 weeks, along with laboratory assessments for all participants at baseline, and a self-selected subgroup at 12 weeks. Randomization to the intervention or placebo arms will be stratified by membership in the 12-week follow-up laboratory subgroup and sex. Laboratory draws will be performed at the participant's local clinical laboratory and will allow for measurements of putative biomarkers of neuron health and structural integrity along with biomarkers of inflammation and immune signaling. Monitoring phone calls will be made to the participant biweekly to assess safety. Participants will also undergo subjective assessments of physical health, vitality, sleep, pain, and symptom severity at baseline, 6, 12, and 16 weeks. Thus, participants will be observed through the treatment period (12 weeks) and for 4 weeks after completion to assess immediate effects and durability of the response."

Current exclusionary diagnosis that could reasonably explain the symptoms of their fatiguing illness and their severity, using the exclusion criteria best described in the Ambiguities in case definition paper for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), as described in detail in Reeves et al., 2003, which clarifies exclusionary conditions. Specifically, the exclusionary diagnoses that are not otherwise listed above comprise:\n\n   * organ failure (e.g., emphysema, cirrhosis, cardiac failure, chronic renal failure)\n   * chronic infections (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis B or C) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (via self report)\n   * major neurologic diseases that could cause fatigue or neurologic deficits such as (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's disease) or history of CNS demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder) (Self report),\n   * cancer or cancer treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation of brain), or current use of biologic modifiers that could affect immune function (e.g., Etanercept, Rituximab) (self-report)\n   * untreated primary sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy)\n   * uncontrolled diabetes (HgbA1c \\> 7)\n9. Temporary conditions discovered at screening for which participants may be rescreened 6 weeks after resolution of condition.\n\n   * Temporary effects of medications\n   * Temporary sleep deprivation\n   * Untreated hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism that has been inadequately controlled during the last 3 months, or free T4 level not within normal limit\n   * Active infection\n10. Participating in another interventional clinical trial of an investigational therapy (including social-behavioral therapy) within 6 weeks prior to consent to participate in this study, or planning to participate in another interventional clinical trial of an investigational therapy during this study,\n11. Use of Bacopa within 6 weeks prior to the enrollment in this study,\n12. Diagnosed bleeding disorder or current use of anticoagulants and/or antiplatelets, except for low dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS).",
