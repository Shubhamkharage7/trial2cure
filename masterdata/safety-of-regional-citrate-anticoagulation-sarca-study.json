            "detailedDescription": "In short, AKI is a major complication in intensive care patients, often occurring in the context of multiple organ failure, and some of these patients may need CRRT. The major advantage of CRRT is improved hemodynamic stability compared to intermittent HD. Continuous anticoagulation during CRRT may be needed to prevent premature clotting of the circuit and deliver the prescribed dialysis dose. Unfractionated heparin is the most commonly used anticoagulation during CRRT mainly as a result of familiarity, low cost, and ease of administration. But the main drawback is the risk of bleeding.\n\nAn alternative technique to avoid systemic anticoagulation is regional extracorporeal anticoagulation with citrate (RCA). The advantages of RCA are improved circuit patency and fewer bleeding complications. The use of RCA may also reduce the ICU staff workload. Studies have shown longer filter running times which reduced circuit change and set-up time. In addition, anticoagulation related bleeding, and CRRT-related blood transfusions were minimized. Therefore, CRRT with RCA might be more economical than conventional anticoagulation.\n\nThe study is to explore the possibility of using the multiFiltrate PRO system with the Ci-Ca module, Cifoban\u00ae (Trisodium citrate 4%), Calrecia\u00ae (Calcium chloride dihydrate), Ci-Ca dialysate K2 and K4, AV1000 (disposable cassette), and multiBic solution in subjects who are critically ill and receiving CRRT in an acute setting."
