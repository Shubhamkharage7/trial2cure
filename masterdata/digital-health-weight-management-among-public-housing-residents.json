The mHealth group consists of a 1-year text messaging program to promote diet and physical activity behavior changes and the CHW support consists of monthly phone counseling delivered by a CHW to support the text messaging program. Our hypothesis is that the mHealth+CHW group will be more effective in bringing about weight loss compared to mHealth alone or the assessment only control group. The findings are expected to inform future health promotion efforts among residents in public housing developments."
