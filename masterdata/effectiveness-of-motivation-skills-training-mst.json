            "briefSummary": "This study will take place at four outpatient clinics serving adults with serious mental illness. Informed consent will be obtained from N=80 individuals with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses (DSM)-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria to participate in a randomized controlled trial comparing Motivation Skills Training (MST) to a Healthy Behaviors Control (HBC) group. Eligible participants will receive a baseline assessment including sociodemographic and psychosocial assessments, measures of motivation, goal attainment, and quality of life, as well as measures of executive skills, community functioning, and psychiatric symptoms severity. Both MST and HBC will be implemented as once weekly group therapies. The treatment phase is approximately 12-14 weeks. MST will focus on motivation knowledge and self-regulation skills while HBC will focus on physical health and health-related skills.",
            "detailedDescription": "Schizophrenia is a major public health problem associated with core motivational deficits that are amongst the strongest predictors of impaired functional outcomes. Without motivation, people are unable to maintain their pursuit of employment or educational goals, engage in treatment, and regularly participate in healthy life decisions. Current pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia have demonstrated limited effectiveness for improving this core symptom. Motivation Skills Training (MST) is a novel intervention that addresses this clinical need. The premise of MST is that knowledge about one's level and sources of motivation underlies the ability to regulate (i.e., understand and manage) motivation, and that motivation self-regulation can in turn facilitate task initiation and persistence. By facilitating goal-directed behavior, MST aims to enhance daily functioning and goal attainment in people with schizophrenia. MST teaches people about motivation and how to self-regulate motivation, empowering individuals to become active agents in controlling their own motivation and behavior. This study uses a 2-phase model of intervention testing to establish the feasibility, acceptability and pilot effectiveness of MST for adults ages 18-65 with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. An initial open trial of MST in one outpatient clinic will provide stakeholder input on the acceptability and clinical utility of MST content and format, informing refinements to the treatment manual. A subsequent randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of MST versus a Healthy Behaviors Control (HBC) group, both conducted in the context of routine recovery-oriented services."
