After the removal of as much tumor tissue as possible, a modified oncolytic adenovirus is injected into the wall of the resection cavity and any residual tumor tissue. The goal of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the injected adenovirus. This treatment is combined with a combination of oral 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and valganciclovir (vGCV) prodrug therapy. Following the surgery, patients will be treated with fractionated radiosurgery (fSRS). Patients will be monitored for 30 days before they start on next line anti-cancer therapy."

Men must use barrier protection for the duration of treatment and for at least 90 days after surgery with intratumor virus inoculation treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute infection. Acute infection is defined by any viral, bacterial, or fungal infection that has required active treatment and caused oral temperature \\>38.5oC and/or clinically significant leukocytosis\n* Serum antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Previous history of liver disease including autoimmune or viral hepatitis\n* Positive serologic test for Hepatitis B or C at baseline\n* Immunosuppressive therapy except for corticosteroid use\n* Serious medical or psychiatric illness or concomitant medication, which, in the judgment of the investigator, might interfere with the subject's ability to respond to or tolerate the treatment or complete the trial\n* Impaired immunity or susceptibility to serious viral infections\n* Pregnant or lactating females\n* Allergy to any product used on the protocol\n* Patient is not able to undergo a brain MRI.\n* Patients who are not eligible for debulking surgery or resection of recurrent disease will be considered ineligible.",
