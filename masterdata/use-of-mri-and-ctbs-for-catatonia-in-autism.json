This application will use a participant's own individual brain magnetic resonance image to target the primary motor strip with transcranial magnetic stimulation; to determine if hyper-excitability of the brain directly correlates with symptoms of catatonia and social-emotional impairment in autism. Completion of this project would result in the first study to associate hyper-excitability of the brain with catatonia and core features of autism; findings which are likely to have a significant impact on the health and well-being of autistic individuals."
