We hypothesize that providing cotinine biomarker results to pediatricians, personalized cotinine feedback to parents about their child's toxin exposure, and offering support to all household tobacco users to quit tobacco use (Biomarker Informed Outreach (BIO)) when added to the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure (CEASE) intervention will increase delivery of tobacco cessation assistance, increase household cessation, reduce tobacco smoke exposure in children, and be cost-effective. This is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with family-level randomization to either CEASE+BIO or CEASE arms at the time of the child's baseline visit. To compare the effectiveness of CEASE+BIO vs. CEASE, we will follow-up with enrolled parents 12 months later to assess parental quit rate and children's tobacco smoke exposure."
