            "briefSummary": "The proposed research will utilize electroacupuncture, a type of needleless acupuncture that uses electrostimulation, in a randomized, double blind study, to evaluate the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing spinal surgeries with the transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) compared to patients without TEAS.",
            "detailedDescription": "The rates of PONV will be evaluated over the first 24 hours after surgery, opioid consumption in units of morphine equivalence, and any adverse side effects will be recorded. Subjects who are included in the research will be randomly assigned to one of two groups - one group is the control group, receiving no TEAS, and the other group receiving TEAS. An anesthesiologist trained in acupuncture will utilize the Excel Pointer to locate the specific acupoints previously identified as associated with prevention PONV. Anesthesiologist will place electrocardiogram (ECG) pads at the identified acupoints prior to surgery. Subjects will be connected to the ES-130 (electro-therapy) device upon entering the operating room. Prior to the surgical closure, the unblinded researcher will initiate delivery of TEAS, or not, according to study protocol based on the randomization group of the participant. The anesthesiologist will not know the group assignment. At the end of surgery, the subject will be disconnected from the ES-130 and the ECG pads will be carefully removed. Researchers will follow up with the subject in recovery regarding any occurrence and severity of PONV, adverse events, and verbal pain scores, until 24 hours after end of surgery."
