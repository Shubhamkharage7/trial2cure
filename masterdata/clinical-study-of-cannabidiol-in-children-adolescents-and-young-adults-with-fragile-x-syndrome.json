            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-center study, to assess the efficacy and safety of Cannabidiol administered as ZYN002 for the treatment of children, adolescent, and young adult patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Eligible participants will participate in up to an 18-week treatment period, where all participants will receive placebo or active study drug. Patients ages 3 to \\< 30 years will be eligible to participate.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-center study, to assess the efficacy and safety of ZYN002, a pharmaceutically manufactured cannabidiol, formulated as a clear gel that can be applied to the skin (called transdermal delivery), in children, adolescents, and young adults with FXS. 250 male and female patients, ages 3 to \\< 30 years, will be randomized 1:1 to either trial drug or placebo and will undergo an 18-week treatment period. Randomization will be stratified by gender, methylation status and weight. The study will be comprised of a Screening visit and a combination of seven visits both onsite (face-to-face) and virtual. The assignment of study drug or placebo will be done by a computer-generated system and neither the study doctor, participant or their caregivers will know which treatment is being given to them. The dose of the treatment will depend on the weight of the participants. If the participants weigh less than or equal to 30 kg, they will receive 2 sachets of the gel per day (1 sachet approximately every 12 hours). If the participant weighs more than 30 kg but less than or equal to 50 kg, they will receive 4 sachets of gel per day (2 sachets approximately every 12 hours). Participants who weigh more than 50 kg will receive 6 sachets of gel per day (3 sachets approximately every 12 hours). Parents/ caregivers will be instructed on proper application of the gel. The gel will be applied to clean, dry, intact skin of the upper arms/ shoulders.\n\nBlood samples will be collected for safety analysis of ZYN002. An independent analytical laboratory will also perform CGG repeat and methylation status analyses. Additionally, the parents/caregivers and study doctor will be asked to complete some questionnaires for efficacy and safety assessment."

Psychoactive medications include (but are not limited to) antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications, and medications for sleep.\n* If patients are receiving non-pharmacological, behavioral and/or dietary interventions, they must be stable and have been doing so for three months prior to screening.\n* Patients have a body mass index between 12-30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and patients with a body mass index \\>30 kg/m2 and \\<40 kg/m2 with normal liver function laboratory values and with no immediate family history of fatty liver disease.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at all designated visits.\n* Patients and parents/caregivers must be adequately informed of the nature and risks of the study and given written informed consent prior to Screening.\n* Patients and parents/caregivers agree to abide by all study restrictions and comply with all study procedures, and in the Investigator's opinion, are reliable and willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy; females of childbearing potential and male patients with a partner of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception as outlined below for the duration of therapy and for three months after the last dose of study medication. Standard acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse from screening to three months after the last dose of study medication: abstinence only applicable for females \\<18 years) or the use of a highly effective method of contraception, including hormonal contraception, diaphragm, cervical cap, vaginal sponge, condom, spermicide, vasectomy, or intrauterine device. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) is not an acceptable method of contraception.\n* Patient has transitioned to independent living or living in a residential facility such as a university setting or congregate care.\n* History of significant allergic condition, significant drug-related hypersensitivity, or allergic reaction to any compound or chemical class related to ZYN002 or its excipients.\n* Exposure to any investigational drug or device less than or equal to 30 days prior to Screening or at any time during the study.\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or total bilirubin levels greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal or alkaline phosphatase levels greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal.\n* Use of cannabis or any THC or CBD-containing product within 3 months of Screening Visit or during the study (aside from ZYN002).\n* Patient has a positive drug screen, including ethanol, cocaine, THC, barbiturates, amphetamines (unless prescribed), benzodiazepines (except midazolam or comparable administered for blood draws and ECG collection), and opiates.\n* Patient is using the following AEDs (medications for the treatment of seizures and/ or epilepsy): clobazam, phenobarbital, ethosuximide, felbamate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or vigabatrin.\n* Patient is using a strong inhibitor/inducer of CYP3A4 or sensitive substrate of CYP3A4 including but not limited to the following medications: midazolam (except single doses administered for the purposes of obtaining blood samples and ECG's), oral ketoconazole, fluconazole, nefazadone, rifampin, alfentanil, alfuzosin, amiodarone, cyclosporine, dasatinib, docetaxol, eplerenone, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, halofantrine, irinotecan, lapatinib, levomethadyl, lumefantrine, nilotinib, pimozide, quinidine, ranolazine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, temsirolimus, toremifene, tretinioin, vincristine, vinorelbine, St. John's Wort, and grapefruit Juice/products.\n* Patients may not be taking any benzodiazepines (except single doses administered for the purposes of obtaining blood samples and ECGs) at screening or throughout the study.\n* Patient is expected to initiate or change pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic interventions during the course of the study.\n* Patient has an advanced, severe, or unstable disease that may interfere with the study outcome evaluations.\n* Patient has acute or progressive neurological disease, psychosis, schizophrenia or any other psychiatric disorder or severe mental abnormalities (other than FXS) that are likely to require changes in drug therapy or interfere with the study objectives or ability to adhere to protocol requirements.\n* Patient has a positive result for the presence of HBsAg, HCV, or HIV antibodies.\n* Patient has known history of cardiovascular disease, advanced arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, cardiac conduction problems, exercise-related cardiac events including syncope and pre-syncope, risk factors for Torsades de pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome), or other serious cardiac problems.\n* Any clinically significant condition or abnormal findings at the Screening Visit that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude study participation or interfere with the evaluation of the study medication.\n* Any skin disease or condition including eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, acne, contact dermatitis, scarring, imperfections, lesions, tattoos, or discoloration that may affect treatment application, application site assessments or absorption of the trial drug.\n* History of treatment for, or evidence of, drug abuse within the past year.\n* Previous participation in a ZYN002 study (with the exception of patients who were screen failures in Study ZYN2-CL-016 and did not enter Study ZYN2-CL-017).\n* Patient responds \"yes\" to Question 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS (Children) during Screening or at any time on study.",
