            "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial is to find out the best dose and side effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and atezolizumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is made in the body from vitamin A and helps cells to grow and develop. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and atezolizumab may help treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of tretinoin (ATRA) and atezolizumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based upon the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 criteria.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the efficacy of the combination of ATRA and atezolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC, including progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To study the effect of ATRA on the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in peripheral blood of study patients.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive tretinoin orally (PO) on days 1-3 of cycles 1-3. Patients also receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks."
