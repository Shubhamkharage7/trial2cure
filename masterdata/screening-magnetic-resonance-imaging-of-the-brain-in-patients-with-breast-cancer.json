Phase II clinical trials examine the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention, in this case magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, to learn whether it is helpful in managing a specific disease.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are utilizing screening MRIs of the brain to evaluate breast cancer patients for metastases to the brain. The investigators hope to understand whether screening MRIs of the brain can be implemented into the standard of care to earlier detect brain metastases in a population where screening MRIs of the brain are not currently recommended or systematically performed.\n\nThis trial will contain 4 cohorts:\n\n1. Those with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will undergo screening MRI of the brain as part of a single arm, non-comparative study\n\n2+3. Those with hormone receptor positive/(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/HER2-) and HER2 positive (HER2+) subtypes will be randomized to receipt of screening MRI of the brain or no screening MRI of the brain to definitively test the value of MRI screening.\n\n4. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer being treated with curative intent will undergo screening MRI of the brain as part of a single arm, non-comparative study."

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Participants must possess the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants who have a contraindication to MRI (e.g. noncompatible implanted metallic device for which MRI is absolutely contraindicated).\n* Participants who have chronic kidney disease stage IV-V or end stage renal disease.\n* Participants with a history of anaphylactic reactions to gadolinium.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium-based agents have not been proven to be safe to administer to a developing fetus.
