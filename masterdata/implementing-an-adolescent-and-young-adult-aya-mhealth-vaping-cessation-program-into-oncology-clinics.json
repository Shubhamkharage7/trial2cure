            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to understand e-cigarette use and interest in quitting by exploring e vaping behaviors among a cohort of AYA survivors (N=500). The investigators will also examine demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors associated with vaping behaviors.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nPhase 1.\n\n* Objective 1. Identify characteristics of adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors (AYA CCS) nicotine vaping behaviors (e.g., e-cigarette use, interest in quitting, and quit attempts) and associations with demographic (e.g., sex, race, socioeconomic status, LGBTQ+ identification), cancer-specific (e.g., diagnosis, treatment factors), and psychosocial and behavioral factors.\n* Objective 2. Develop strategies to improve implementation of an evidence-based, mHealth vaping cessation program within an AYA oncology clinic.\n* Objective 2a: Use qualitative interviews to explore patient preferences regarding program implementation (e.g., timing of assessment of vaping behavior, confidentiality, referral approach) and identify barriers to uptake.\n* Objective 2b: Interview and/or ask healthcare providers (e.g., practitioners, advanced practice providers, social workers practicing in AYA oncology settings) to complete open- ended questionnaires related to current processes (e.g., workflow), needs, and barriers for assessing e-cigarette use and vaping cessation referral processes. Evaluate healthcare providers' information needs, preferences, and tools needed for integrating e- cigarette assessment and cessation program referrals into current practice.\n\nPhase 2.\n\n* Objective 3. Develop and test vaping assessment and referral implementation processes (developed from Objectives 1 \\& 2)., and uptake of an established mHealth vaping cessation program\n* Objective 3a: Using qualitative and quantitative measures, we will assess the reach (% of eligible AYA CCS that enrolled in mHealth program), adoption (% providers making referrals), strategy potential (provider/patient perceptions of referral process; appropriateness of program for patients), and maintenance (barriers/facilitators to implementation) of the program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Phase 1.\n\nTo understand the needs and interest of the targeted population, this mixed-method project will first examine e-cigarette use and interest in quitting among a cohort of AYA survivors who range in age from 13-24 on the day of consent and are at least 3 months post treatment completion. Research participants will complete study assessments via REDCap, a HIPAA-compliant, password-protected, data collection and storage platform. AYA survivors who endorse current vaping and desire to quit (N=25) and healthcare providers engaged in AYA oncology care (N=15), will be asked to complete questionnaires related to attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about e-cigarette use.\n\nPhase 2.\n\nUsing data gathered from Phase 1, study investigators will develop implementation strategies by leveraging Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change1 to test implementation processes including systematically assessing vaping behaviors and referring patients to an evidenced based vaping cessation program. Qualitative and quantitative measures will be completed by patients who complete the vaping cessation program and healthcare providers who are engaged in assessment/referral process. These assessments will inform the reach, adoption, and implementation of the program."
