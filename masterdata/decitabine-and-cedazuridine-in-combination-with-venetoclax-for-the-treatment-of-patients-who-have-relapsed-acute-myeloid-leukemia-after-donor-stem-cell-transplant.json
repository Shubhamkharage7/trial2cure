            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well decitabine and cedazuridine (DEC-C) works in combination with venetoclax in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients whose AML has come back after a period of improvement (relapse) after a donor stem cell transplant. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving DEC-C in combination with venetoclax may kill more cancer cells in patients with relapsed AML.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the effect of DEC-C/venetoclax on the investigator-assessed composite complete remission (CR) rate (CR/complete remission with partial hematologic recovery \\[CRh\\]/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery \\[CRi\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the rate of partial response (PR) and morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) following treatment with DEC-C/venetoclax. II. To assess the relapse free survival of patients treated with DEC-C/venetoclax.\n\nIII. To assess overall survival of patients treated with DEC-C/venetoclax. IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of DEC-C/venetoclax in the post-hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) setting.\n\nV. To assess the rates of measurable residual disease negativity in patients achieving a CR.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily for 28 days in a 28-day cycle. Patients receive DEC-C PO daily on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspiration and blood sample collection throughout the study."
