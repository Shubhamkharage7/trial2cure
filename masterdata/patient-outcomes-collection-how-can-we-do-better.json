In this study, the investigators aim to investigate ways by which patient PRO completion rates may be improved.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patient reported outcomes (PROs) are widely used by clinical providers as important tools to help inform their clinical and research practice, and to improve quality of care for patients. In addition, PROs are increasingly cited as a tool in measuring surgical performance and the value of health care services being delivered. The quality of data captured by PROs is, however, largely dependent on patients' response rates, both pre- and post-operatively. For pre-operative surveys, higher response rates may be achieved as patients may be reminded to complete their surveys at an office visit or prior to surgery. However, patient non-compliance presents a major challenge post-operatively, undermining PRO data integrity.\n\nAs clinical practices have moved to using PROs for all patients, rather than just a research tool, automated systems have been developed to deliver and collect PRO electronically. However, while automation has helped streamline PRO administration and data collection, this hasn't always translated into obtaining better PRO compliance rates. In an attempt to improve response rates, efforts have been made to reduce patient burden (by reducing the number of questions asked, for example), to regularly remind patients to complete their forms (either by email or telephone), or even offer patients monetary or non-monetary incentives.\n\nDespite these measures' variable success, however, achieving high response rates remains a challenge. This, in part, is due to the fact these platforms depend heavily on patients receiving the request and their willingness to participate in the program, often long after their care is completed. As data are increasingly used to measure physician performance and quality, as well as to determine reimbursement, low patient compliance rates remain a significant impediment and affect the validity of the data.\n\nIn this study, the invetigators hypothesize that direct patient engagement can improve patient compliance with automated PRO capture."
