            "briefSummary": "An observational prospective study to determine the impact of foam sclerotherapy of large, dominant kidney/liver cysts on quality of life outcomes and kidney/liver cyst volumes at up to 12 months of follow-up in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD).",
            "detailedDescription": "Cyst burden is an important determinant of outcomes in both autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (1, 2) and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD) (3, 4). Furthermore, mass symptoms (from liver and kidney volume) greatly impact upon quality of life in patients with severe disease. Cyst volume increases exponentially with age and results in the development of end-stage renal disease and hypertension, compromised quality of life due to compressive symptoms, and predisposes patients to cyst complications such as infection, hemorrhage, rupture, and torsion. Existing percutaneous treatments for cyst burden in ADPKD and ADPLD include cyst aspiration with or without sclerotherapy. Although frequently effective in the short-term, recurrence rates and the need for repeat procedures are high after these procedures (5, 6). Extrarenal disease (primarily liver disease) is the most important aspect of disease burden to ADPKD patients (7), and there are few effective treatments.\n\nFoam sclerotherapy (FS) with 3% Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate (STS) a sclerosing agent. (Sotradecol\u00ae; Mylan, Galway, Ireland) is approved by the FDA for the management of varicose veins. While increasing cyst burden significantly compromises quality of life, the impact of FS on patient-reported outcomes has not been evaluated. In collaboration with the Center for Science of Healthcare delivery, we have developed a patient-reported outcome tool for polycystic liver disease capable of detecting symptom burden in individuals with polycystic liver disease that has been approved by the FDA as a patient-reported outcomes tool in research. Furthermore measurement of liver and kidney volumes can be performed in the Polycystic Kidney Disease Imaging Research Core that monitors organ volumes before and after interventions. At this time, patients are interested in procedures that will alleviate and palliate their mass symptoms but desire preliminary information on the procedural efficacy. We aim to report our experience with a new therapeutic advance - FS for the treatment of liver and kidney cysts at Mayo Clinic - and to determine the impact of this procedure on patient-reported quality of life measures and changes in organ volumes."
