            "briefSummary": "This study assesses how blood cell growth patterns (clonal hematopoiesis), relates to heart health or cardiovascular disease (CVD) after treatment in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. In some patients, cancer treatment at a young age may lead to later complications, including problems with heart health. Checking for blood cell growth patterns called therapy-related clonal hematopoiesis (t-CH) can help predict who might be at risk for heart health problems after Hodgkin lymphoma treatment. If doctors know who may be at greater risk for developing later heart complications, then they can more closely monitor those patients to prevent or detect heart complications early.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the prevalence of participants in AHOD1331 with therapy-related clonal hematopoiesis (t-CH) possessing somatic mutations associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) which are detected after Hodgkin Lymphoma therapy.\n\nII. To assess participants of AHOD1331 with t-CH for the presence or absence of objective signs of CVD using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess whether participants in AHOD1331 with t-CH expand this population over time and possess objective findings of CVD.\n\nII. To assess whether patients both with and without objective findings of CVD using cardiac MRI possess clinical risk factors for CVD.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the prevalence of patients receiving mediastinal radiation who have objective findings of CVD using cardiac MRI, that also possess t-CH with mutations associated with CVD.\n\nII. To assess whether specific patient characteristics and treatment (age, gender, race, dexrazoxane usage, etc.) correlate with a higher incidence of t-CH with mutations associated with CVD.\n\nIII. To assess the effects of t-CH on CVD by considering other factors such as patient characteristics and clinical conditions associated with an elevated risk for CVD.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples, complete surveys, and undergo cardiac MRI on study. Patients also have their medical records reviewed."
