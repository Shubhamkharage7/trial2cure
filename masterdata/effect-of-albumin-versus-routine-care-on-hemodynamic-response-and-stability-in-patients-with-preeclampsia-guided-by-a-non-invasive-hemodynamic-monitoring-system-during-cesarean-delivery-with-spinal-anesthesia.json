The hypothesis is that volume replacement with albumin guided by stroke volume variation (SVV) using a ClearSight-Acumen (CS-A) monitor, before cesarean delivery (CD), improves hemodynamic stability in preeclamptic patients with severe features compared to routine care, under neuraxial anesthesia."

In study participants, the finger cuff will be placed on the middle finger of one of the hands. The Edwards device can be used to predict impending intraoperative hypotension before its occurrence. The device has the ability to assess vasodilatory status using systemic vascular resistance (SVR), volume status using stroke volume variation (SVV) and stroke volume (SV) and the use of Carbon Monoxide (CO) to assess for underlying cardiac suppression. It also incorporates the hypotension prediction index (HPI), an algorithm that uses the arterial waveform to predict early phases of intraoperative hypotension.",
