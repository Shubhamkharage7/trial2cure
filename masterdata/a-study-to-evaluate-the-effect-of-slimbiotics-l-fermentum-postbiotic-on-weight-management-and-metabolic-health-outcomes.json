This study will be conducted as a hybrid trial consisting of both in-person visits and virtual assessments. Two groups will be included: the intervention (SlimBiotics postbiotic) and placebo.\n\nThe SlimBiotics postbiotic formula is the first plant-based postbiotic targeting weight management and metabolic health. Other competing postbiotics are isolated from humans (feces) but the strains in SlimBiotics were isolated from a fermented plant (millet porridge cereal)\n\nThis product contains L. fermentum K8 Postbiotic."
