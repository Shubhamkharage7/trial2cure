To estimate the cost-effectiveness, defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved, of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) versus ovarian cancer screening (OCS) for women at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer over a five-year period, using data from GOG-0199 to model survival.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the cost-effectiveness, defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved, of RRSO versus OCS for women at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer over a lifetime, using stage-specific cohorts and population-based data to model long-term survival. (Exploratory) II. To use value of information (VOI) methodology to set future research priorities aimed at developing evidence-based approaches to the management of women who are at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer. (Exploratory)\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nOutcome data, such as incidence and stage at diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers; number and timing of screening and serum tests performed; number and timing of pelvic ultrasounds performed; surgical procedures performed; cancer-specific and overall survival (if available); and the incidence, type, and grade of significant adverse events, are collected from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-0199 records and analyzed.
