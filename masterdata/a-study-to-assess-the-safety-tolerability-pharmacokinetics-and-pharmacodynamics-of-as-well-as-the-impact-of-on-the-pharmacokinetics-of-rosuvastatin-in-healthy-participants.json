Part C of this study will investigate the possibility of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between IV AZD4144 and oral rosuvastatin by evaluating the PK of rosuvastatin when administered alone and in combination with single IV dose of AZD4144.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I, randomized study in healthy participants and consists of 3 parts; Part A, Part B and Part C. Part A and B are single-blind, placebo-controlled with single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) sequential group design, respectively. Part C is an open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over design study. Part A and B of the study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AZD4144 solution for infusion compared with placebo while Part C will investigate the possibility of DDI between IV AZD4144 and oral rosuvastatin by evaluating the PK of rosuvastatin when administered alone and in combination with single IV dose of AZD4144.\n\nThe study will comprise of:\n\n* A screening period of maximum 28 days.\n* A residential period which lasts from,\n\n  * Day -1 to Day 4 (single dose on Day 1) for Part A\n  * Day -1 to Day 15 (dosed on days 1, 4-12) for Part B\n  * Day -1 to Day 3 (dose on Day 1) and Day 9 to Day 12 (dose on Day 10) for Part C\n* A final follow-up visit,\n\n  * On Day 10+3 for Part A\n  * On Day 20+3 for Part B and C"
