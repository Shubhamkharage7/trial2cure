In one procedure the blockages are ballooned and then stented with a small wire mesh tube through a small incision in the wrist or the groin. The other procedure is an open-heart operation in which healthy blood vessels from inside the chest, leg, and/or forearm are used to \"bypass\" the blockages (like a detour). Outcomes will be measured by comparing survival and improvement in quality-of-life.",
            "detailedDescription": "The RECHARGE: Women Trial is a multicenter, 1:1 randomized, open-label superiority trial.\n\nPatients meeting the eligibility criteria for whom there is equipoise for revascularization with CABG and PCI, as determined by the local Heart Team, will be included. Participants will be followed for 5-10 years. Telephone follow-up will be conducted by the a central follow-up coordinating center at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and thereafter every 6 months through 36 months post-randomization. After 36 months, follow-up will be performed every year (48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120 months). A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram and blood draw for serum creatinine, hemoglobin and lipids should be performed at 1 year, as per standard of care, at either an out-patient facility or in a hospital."
