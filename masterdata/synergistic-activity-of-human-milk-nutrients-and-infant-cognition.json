There will be 84 breastfeeding dyads, 3 months postnatal.\n\nMothers will be randomized to a whole egg or egg white (due to lack of an appropriate control food). Initial diet intake will be screened using the NDSR. Participants will come to the lab 3 times across 3 months (age 3 months, 4.5 months, and 6 months). Milk, saliva, and plasma will be collected from the mother, while saliva and plasma (heel stick) are collected from the infant. Diet data will be collected at each visit. The infant will complete a recognition memory test using electrophysiology at 6 months as well as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 4.5 months. The mother will complete a temperament questionnaire at 3 months and 6 months."
