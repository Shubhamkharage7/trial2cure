            "briefSummary": "PSC is a liver disease that has no medical cure. Patients with PSC are at a greatly increased risk of cancer and infection. Additionally, many patients require a liver transplant. Progress towards a cure has been severely limited by an incomplete understanding of why patients develop PSC. The investigators aim to close this gap by conducting a pilot human study in patients with PSC, using statin therapy as a model",
            "detailedDescription": "Database studies have suggested that use of statins is associated with lower mortality in patients with PSC. Statins are also safe, widely used medications for the treatment of high cholesterol. This track record of safety makes repurposing statins for use in PSC an attractive option.\n\nThis study will evaluate the impact of bile acid profile and the microbiome. Rosuvastatin induced changes in cell signaling pathways in the body, as well as its impact of bacterial gene expression in the microbiome will be evaluated. The investigators anticipate that this study will provide key insights into the biologic basis of PSC, which may aid in the development of drugs for the treatment of PSC.\n\nThis research study will enroll patients with PSC. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: baseline measurements, study period (treatment with rosuvastatin), and follow-up (follow-up after completing statin treatment). All patients will receive the study drug, and no patients will receive placebo treatment. Rosuvastatin is FDA approved for treatment of high cholesterol, but its use in this trial is off label."
