            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare, at 3 months, the effects of a yoga intervention on physical health, including balance, muscle strength, physical activity levels, cardiac autonomic function, and physical vulnerability, as well as psychological health, including depressive symptoms and anxiety, in cardiac patients who are older than 65 years old and randomized to the intervention or control group. The main questions aim to 1) determine if yoga can improve physical health outcomes such as balance, muscle strength, cardiac function, and physical vulnerability in older adults with cardiovascular disease, and 2) determine if yoga can positively impact psychological health, including reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety in this population. Participants in the intervention group will attend yoga sessions twice a week for three months. The intervention group will be asked to complete surveys and physical function assessments at the beginning and three months later. Researchers will compare the intervention group and the control group to see if there is any difference and improvement in physical and psychological health between the two groups."
