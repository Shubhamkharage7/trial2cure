            "briefSummary": "This project focuses on African American (AA) men and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) men with prostate cancer (PCa) in Brooklyn/Queens catchment. Evidence from randomized clinical trials support the efficacy of decision navigation intervention, with navigated patients showing greater confidence in their decisions about cancer treatment and less regret. The investigators will develop and test the acceptability and feasibility of a decision navigation intervention for AA or H/L men with prostate cancer.\n\nThe primary aim for this study is to adapt and tailor an evidence based decision navigation intervention for AA and H/L men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa). The investigators hypothesize that men in the decision navigation intervention arm will report higher levels of decision self-efficacy, less decisional conflict, and regret about their treatment decisions compared to men engaged in standard of care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Objectives This study will develop and test the acceptability and feasibility of a decision navigation intervention (DNI) for AA or H/L men with PCa through consideration of the role of partners and family members in the decision-making process.\n\nHypotheses / Research Questions Among AA or H/L men diagnosed with early stage PCa, the primary aims of this study are to:\n\nAim 1:\n\nAdapt and tailor an evidence-based decision navigation intervention (DNI) for AA and H/L men diagnosed with prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that key concepts around information sharing and counseling, health behavior coordination, and emotional social support will be elicited\n\nAim 2:\n\nEvaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the tailored DNI among AA and H/L men newly diagnosed with prostate. First, the investigators hypothesize that feasibility and acceptability benchmarks will be met. Second, the investigators hypothesize that men in the DNI arm will report higher levels of decision self-efficacy, less decisional conflict, and regret about their treatment decisions at 6 months, compared to men engaged in standard-of-care (SOC). Third, the investigators hypothesize (exploratory) that men in the DNI arm will engage more in discussions about appropriate clinical trials, resulting in more navigated men considering clinical trial enrollment, compared to men receiving SOC.\n\nOverall Design\n\nThis study will be conducted in two Groups:\n\nEstablished Prostate Cancer Group:\n\nEstablished Prostate Cancer Group will consist of a qualitative study of 12 semi-structured interviews with self-identified AA patient undergoing prostate treatment (stages I-III) (N-12 patients) and 12 semi-structured interviews with H/L patient undergoing prostate treatment (stages I-III) (N=12 patients) at NYPHQueens and NYPH-BM. Interview content will focus on psychosocial and sociocultural factors associated with PCa decision making, social support, and physician-patient communication.\n\nAt Risk of Prostate Cancer Group:\n\nAt Risk of Prostate Cancer Group will recruit 58 self-identified AA or H/L men at risk of prostate cancer (stages I-III) receiving care at NYPH-Queens and NYPHQ (29 at each hospital) to participate in the evaluation of the tailored DNI intervention. Men who consent to participate in the study will complete a baseline survey. After biopsy appointment, participants with a negative Prostate Cancer biopsy will receive a study closure phone call, ending study participation. Participants with positive Prostate Cancer biopsy will proceed with study procedures and be randomly assigned to DNI or SOC. Participants with a positive Prostate Cancer biopsy will be followed for 6 months and complete assessments at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months (close of the study)."
