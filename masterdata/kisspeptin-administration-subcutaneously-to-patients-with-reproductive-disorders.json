The investigators are also examining whether kisspeptin can help women release eggs from their ovaries. Kisspeptin will be administered subcutaneously (SC) for two weeks in a pulsatile fashion. Ultrasound monitoring of ovarian follicular growth and frequent blood sampling (every 10 minutes for up to two hours) will be performed to assess the physiologic response to kisspeptin over time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Assignment: All study subjects will undergo the same interventions.\n\nDelivery of Interventions:\n\n* The subject will undergo a review of their medical history, physical exam, and screening laboratories.\n* A pelvic ultrasound will be performed to assess baseline follicular size.\n* A pump may be placed to administer pulsatile SC gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) for approximately six days.\n* A pump will be placed to administer pulsatile SC kisspeptin for two weeks.\n* During the course of kisspeptin administration, subjects will\n\n  * Undergo q10 min blood sampling (approximately 4 sessions, 2 hours each)\n  * Undergo pelvic ultrasounds (approximately 4 sessions)\n* Optional q10 min sampling up to 10 hours may take place before and after the course of kisspeptin"
