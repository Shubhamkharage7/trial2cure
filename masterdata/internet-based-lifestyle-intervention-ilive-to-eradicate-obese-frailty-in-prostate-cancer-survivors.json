            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial tests the effectiveness of an online weight loss plus resistance training intervention (iLIVE) to decrease obesity and improve frailty in men with prostate cancer who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Androgen deprivation therapy increases the risk of frailty, weight gain and obesity in prostate cancer survivors. The combination of frailty and obesity can lead to a decrease in quality of life and an increased risk of recurrent falls. Using iLIVE may improve obesity and frailty in men with prostate cancer who receive ADT.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To test the effectiveness of a combined online weight loss plus resistance training intervention (iLIVE) on obese frailty in prostate cancer survivors (PCS) on ADT.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To understand the effect of iLIVE on health behaviors, physical functioning, and quality of life II. To understand facilitators and barriers to implementing iLIVE in clinical and community practice\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to arm I or II. Key stakeholders are identified for implementation outcomes\n\nARM I: Patients receive online access to an interactive weight loss website and participate in online group based resistance training sessions (iLIVE) on study. Patients also use a Fitbit fitness tracker and Aria (registered trademark) smart scale while on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive usual care with access to online survivorship and exercise recommendations and use a Fitbit fitness tracker and Aria (registered trademark) smart scale while on study.\n\nPatients are followed for 6 months after completion of intervention.\n\nKey stakeholders complete an interview while on study to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation of iLIVE into clinical practice."
