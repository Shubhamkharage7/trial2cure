Subjective measures, alveolar carbon monoxide, blood pressure and cigarettes per a day will be collected remotely. Biological samples will be collected at home and mailed to the study clinic.",
            "detailedDescription": "Smokers of cigarettes with about 16-30% ventilation in their conventional cigarettes who meet eligibility criteria will enter 3 weeks of monitoring of usual brand smoking. Subjects will then be randomly assigned for a period of 6 weeks to one of two conditions: 1) ventilated cigarettes; or 2) unventilated cigarettes. Subjects in each condition will be unblinded to simulate real world conditions. Subjects are provided with a debit card (ClinCard) that has been loaded with the appropriate amount of money to cover self-purchased usual brand cigarette in baseline and the assigned study cigarettes during intervention. Weekly telehealth visits will be conducted during baseline and the 6 weeks on study cigarettes to collect study measures, followed by a one month follow-up."
