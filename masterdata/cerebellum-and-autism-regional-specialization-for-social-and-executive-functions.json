            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to determine the impact of neuromodulation to the cerebellum on social and executive functions in neurotypical young adults and young adults with autism.",
            "detailedDescription": "Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and inflexible behaviors. There are currently few biologically-targeted treatment options for autism, in part because the underlying neurobiology is not well understood. One region of the brain that is consistently implicated in autism is the cerebellum. Specifically, two cerebellar subregions show structural and functional differences in autism: right cerebellar lobule VII (RVII) and the posterior cerebellar vermis. Based on the different anatomical connectivity of these regions, the investigators hypothesize that RVII and the posterior vermis regulate different core deficits in autism. In this study, the investigators combine cerebellar neuromodulation with functional neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that neuromodulation targeting RVII will selectively alter social learning and neural networks supporting social behavior, while neuromodulation targeting the posterior vermis will impact cognitive flexibility and neural networks involved in the allocation of attention. Neurotypical adults and adults with autism will complete social and cognitive flexibility tasks after excitatory, inhibitory, or sham neuromodulation in a within-subjects design. Some participants will receive neuromodulation targeting RVII and others will receive neuromodulation targeting the posterior vermis. The investigators will acquire functional brain imaging data during and after cerebellar neuromodulation, which will allow the team to better understand the mechanisms by which non-invasive neuromodulation might impact behavior in clinical disorders."
