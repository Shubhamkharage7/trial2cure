Currently members only receive the SCC if they are: 1) identified as high risk for readmission upon discharge from the hospital, 2) are self-referred, or 3) are directly referred to the program by their physician. The current quality improvement study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to determine if the expansion of the SCC program to commercially insured members identified via a proprietary administrative algorithms as being at high risk would significantly impact rates of acute inpatient admissions."
