The overall goals of this proposal are to determine whether 16 weeks of structured high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can overcome vascular and cognitive impairments (Aim 1) to a greater extent than continuous moderate exercise. Additionally, investigator will seek to identify barriers to engagement in exercise and the participants' perceptions of the study and exercise interventions (Aim 2). This study will enroll 60 participants in Birmingham, Alabama. Data collection will occur at each visit, with baseline data collected at the initial visit with a 3-month follow-up occurring following completion of the intervention.",

Additionally, investigator will seek to identify barriers to engagement in exercise and the participants' perceptions of the study and exercise interventions (Aim 2). This study will enroll 60 participants in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nVascular function will be measured using pulse wave velocity. Cognition will be assessed using the full neuropsychological battery. Additionally, perceptions of exercise and the study as well as barriers to engaging in exercise will be determined through the analysis qualitative interviews.\n\nThe overall hypothesis is that HIIT will result in greater enhancements in vascular and cognitive function. The investigators expect that individuals randomized to HIIT will result in greater satisfaction with the protocol. Based on the data collected, the investigators seek to develop tailored intervention to promote successful aging among older people living with HIV."
