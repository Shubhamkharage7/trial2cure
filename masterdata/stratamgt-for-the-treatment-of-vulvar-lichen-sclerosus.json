This study will consist of a two-week screening period and an 8-week treatment period. At the beginning of the screening period, a vulvoscopy will be performed at the screening visit and after the 8-week treatment period to rule out vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) or carcinoma. All patients will have a 4mm punch biopsy at screening (week 0) and after 8 weeks of treatment (week 10).\n\nThe primary efficacy variable will be performed by a dermatopathologist who will evaluate the inflammatory infiltration on biopsy specimens obtained during the screening period and after treatment at the Week 10 visit (0 to 3 scale).\n\nSecondary efficacy endpoints will be change in score on the Vulvar Quality of Life Index (VQLI), the Skindex 29, and the Clinical Lichen Sclerosus Scoring Scale (CLISSCO)."

Subjects who screen positive for either candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis at the screening visit may be treated and retested and may participate if the confirmatory test after treatment is negative. Any vulvovaginal infections during participation in the study will be considered an adverse event. The subject will then stop the study IP and will be treated for the infection and may resume use of the IP 3 days after the last dose of medication for the infection. Participants will be discontinued from the study if participants have two infections during the study.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nSubjects to be excluded are those:\n\n* Who have received systemic immunosuppressants (e.g. corticosteroids) within 12 weeks prior to participation in the study.\n* Who have been treated with topical therapy (e.g., topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical estrogen, topical testosterone) at the affected area within 12 weeks prior to participation in the study.\n* Who use topical emollients, lubricants (other than for penetrative intercourse),or any other topical products for symptom control at the affected area within 4 weeks prior to participation in the study.\n* Prior history of, or active Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN) or vulvar carcinoma.\n* Who are immunocompromised (e.g., lymphoma, AIDS, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) or have an uncontrolled malignant disease.\n* Who suffer from systemic or generalized infections (bacterial, viral or fungal).\n* Who have been diagnosed with lichen planus, psoriasis, candidiasis, intraepithelial neoplasia, or carcinoma of the vulva.\n* Who had received an investigational drug within four weeks prior to the study or who intend to use other investigational drugs during the course of this study.\n* Patients with severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study.\n* Who have a history of substance abuse or any factor, which limits the subject's ability to cooperate with the study procedures.\n* Who are uncooperative, known to miss appointments (according to subjects' records) and are unlikely to follow medical instructions or are not willing to attend regularly scheduled visits.",
