            "briefSummary": "Objectives:To assess the safety and tolerability followed by a dose expansion study to characterize safety, and preliminary efficacy of SGN1 in participants with refractory solid tumors.\n\nStudy Rationale:The mechanism of action for SGN1 is based on the fact that most tumors are methionine dependent. SGN1 is designed to be used as a tumor therapeutic bacterium that can preferentially replicate and accumulate in tumors and starve them of essential amino acids by delivering the oncolytic enzyme L-Methioninase.\n\nPatient Population:The treatment populations shall be patients presenting with histologically confirmed advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy and for which no other conventional therapy exists.",
            "detailedDescription": "Methionine starvation can powerfully modulate DNA methylation, cell cycle transition, polyamines and antioxidant synthesis of tumor cells, in contrast to normal ones. L-Methioninase is a pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes the \u03b3-elimination reaction of L-methionine to methanethiol, \u03b1-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Absolute-dependency on exogenous supply of L-methionine, not homocysteine, for growth and proliferation of tumors is the pivotal biochemical criterion for various human cancers.\n\nSGN1 is a genetically modified strain of Salmonella enterica, serotype typhimurium that expresses L-Methioninase. The attenuated live bacterium has been investigated in China for utility in treating advanced solid tumors. The mechanism of action for SGN1 is based on the fact that most tumors are methionine dependent. SGN1 is designed to be used as a tumor therapeutic bacterium that can preferentially replicate and accumulate in tumors and starve them of essential amino acids by delivering the oncolytic enzyme L-Methioninase.\n\nThis study is a multi-center phase I/IIa clinical trial with 3 parts:\n\nPart 1 \\& 2 is an open-label, dose escalation phase. Part 1 is the DLT observation period, and the patients will enter part 2 for extension treatment after completing the DLT observation period.\n\nPart 3 is an open-label, dose expansion phase. In part 2, the treatment may be terminated if the patients withdraws, has unacceptable toxicity, develops disease progression, experiences an AE that cannot be resolved with/without rescue medication and cause stopping study drug for 2 planned administrations, death, or loss to follow-up. In such cases, patients will be discontinued and palliative or rescue therapy will be offered to those that terminate early.\n\nIn part 3, there will be at least 2 tumor types selected, expand between second to four dose level in each tumor type.The Part 3 (Dose expansion stage study) could be started according to the SMC evaluation, do not need waiting the completion the whole cohort of dose escalation (Part 1)."

If this is the highest dose and there have been no DLTs-then 3 more patients must be evaluated at the same dose level to confirm the MTD. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than one (1) DLT is observed among 6 patients.\n\nPart 3 is an open-label, dose expansion phase.

In patients with liver metastasis,ALT and AST\u22645 \u00d7 ULN;\n   4. Creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min (standard Cockcroft -Gault formula) or Cr \u22641.5 \u00d7ULN: urinary protein\u2264 2+ or urinary protein quantitative \\<1.0 g/L;\n   5. International standardized ratio of coagulation function (INR) \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN (If patient has concomitant medication with anticoagulants, whether the coagulation function is qualified will be determined by Investigator.)\n8.

Patients with a history of HCV infection should have completed curative antiviral treatment and HCV viral load below the limit of quantification. Patients with HCV Ab positive but HCV RNA negative due to prior treatment or natural resolution are eligible. Patients on concurrent HCV treatment should have HCV below the limit of quantification.\n12. Patients must be able to follow up after the treatment.\n13. Patients must understand and voluntarily sign the informed consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPatients will be excluded from participation for any of the following criteria:\n\n1.

Present assessable tumors in hollow organs (Stomach, esophagus, intestine, urinary tract etc.).\n4. Present with symptomatic central nervous system metastasis or brain abscess at screening.\n5. Present with diverticulitis or conditions at screening that might promote the unintentional growth of anaerobic bacteria in non target lesions.\n6. Existing cardiac clinical symptoms or diseases that cannot be well controlled, such as:\n\n   1. NYHA grade 2 or above heart failure;\n   2. Unstable angina pectoris;\n   3. Myocardial infarction occurred within 1 year;\n   4. Patients with supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias that have clinical significance and need treatment or intervention;\n   5. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure) \u2265160 mmHg and (diastolic blood pressure) \u2265100 mmHg after drug treatment;\n   6. Patients with valvular heart disease or mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve disease or other source of turbulent cardiac blood flow.\n7.
