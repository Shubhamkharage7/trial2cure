Variables of interest, dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and shift work disorder (SWD) symptoms, will be assessed before and after the intervention, which will last two weeks. All participants (N=50) will be asked to wear an Apple Watch for two weeks leading up to an in-lab visit. Activity data collection from the Apple Watch will be processed through a mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker (previously validated in SWD) to generate estimates of DLMO. This two-week period is followed by a 27-hour laboratory visit for pre-treatment assessment of DLMO (hourly saliva melatonin samples over 24 hours). At the end of this visit, participants will receive an orientation to the SHIFT mobile application, where they will be able to assess their prescribed light exposure schedule."
