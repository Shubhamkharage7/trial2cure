            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of 12 weeks of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango on glucose control, insulin resistance, lipids, inflammation, oxidation and body composition in individuals with prediabetes. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the effect of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango over 12 weeks on indicators of glycemic control including fasting glucose and HgbA1c?\n* What is the effect of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango over 12 weeks on fasting blood insulin and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)?\n* What is the effect of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango over 12 weeks on lipids including LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides?\n* What is the effect of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango over 12 weeks on oxidative stress including oxidized LDL-cholesterol and 8-iso-PGF2-alpha?\n* What is the effect of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango over 12 weeks on markers of inflammation including c-reactive protein, e-selectin, ICAM and VCAM?\n* What is the effect of 1.5 cups per day of fresh mango over 12 weeks on percent body fat, fat mass, and lean mass?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* Consume 1.5 cups of mango per day for 12 weeks, take a 4 week break, and then avoid consuming mangos for 12 weeks\n* Attend a prerandomization clinic prior to study\n* Attend three (3) clinics where blood will be drawn during weeks 0, 12, and 28 of the study\n* Attend eight (8) clinics where anthropometric measurements (height, weight, body composition) will be conducted and interaction with study clinicians will occur during weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 of the study\n* Complete questionnaires and surveys in person and remotely, including six (6) 24-hour dietary recalls.\n\nResearchers will compare the 12 weeks participants consume mango to the 12 weeks the participants are not consuming mango to see if there are differences in glycemic indicators, insulin resistance, lipids, inflammation, oxidation and body composition between the two time periods."
