            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial is being conducted to see if brain stimulation and brain training together improves cognitive functioning and mood in older adults diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Brain stimulation will be done using repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Brain training will be done using immersive virtual reality cognitive training (iVCT) program. The goals of this clinical trail are as follows:\n\n* Examine if rTMS+iVCT intervention can improve and sustain objective cognitive functioning in individuals with MCI more than control or rTMS only groups\n* Examine if rTMS+iVCT intervention improves participants mental health symptoms, functional abilities, and quality of life more than control or rTMS only groups\n* Examine the impact of rTMS+iVCT intervention on caregiver burden.\n\nEligible participants will be assigned to a standard treatment (no intervention control) group, rTMS only group of rTMS+iVCT group. All participants will undergo baseline assessment to evaluate their cognitive, emotional, and functional abilities. Those in the rTMS only group will receive rTMS treatments for five days per week for two weeks (total of ten sessions). Those in the rTMS+iVCT group will receive rTMS treatment followed by iVCT training for five days a week for two weeks (total of ten sessions). All participants will then repeat testing 2 weeks and three months after baseline testing to assess for possible treatment related changes and lasting effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess if combined treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and immersive virtual reality mediated cognitive training program (iVCT) improves cognitive, emotional, and functional abilities in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to usual care. Secondary objective of the study is assess if rTMS+iVCT treatment improves caregiver burden.\n\nOlder Veterans (N=50) age \u2265 55 years with mild cognitive impairment will be recruited. All participants will be screened for suitability for the rTMS and iVCT treatments. Those eligible (N=30) will complete a baseline assessment of their cognitive, emotional, and functional abilities and caregiver burden (Visit 1). Participants (N=30) will be randomly assigned to a rTMS group, rTMS+iVCT group, and control group.. Participants in the rTMS group will receive rTMS treatment daily for 5 days of the week for 2 weeks. Participants in the rTMS+iVCT group will receive rTMS treatment followed by 30-60 minutes of iVCT intervention daily for 5 days of the week for 2 weeks. Participants in the control group will receive usual care. All testing will be repeated posttreatment at 2 weeks (Visit 2) and at 3 months(Visit 3) .\n\nInnovations include combination of two non-pharmacological interventions and the inclusion of 3-month post-treatment testing to assess the durability of changes. Feedback will be gathered to improve the treatment program. Assuming positive findings, this research will help establish a new treatment modality for improving the cognitive, emotional, and functional abilities in MCI."
