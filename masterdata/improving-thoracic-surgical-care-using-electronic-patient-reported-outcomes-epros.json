            "detailedDescription": "Thoracic surgery patients are at high risk for severe complications post-surgery, such as respiratory failure, empyema, wound problems, and even mortality. Patients with complications may need readmission and invasive management. Usual care may not capture the symptoms of surgery complications. Well-designed remote monitoring of postoperative patients may enable early intervention and lower the risk of severe complications.\n\nThis study evaluates the implementation and effectiveness of perioperative electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) monitoring in thoracic surgery patients. Previous studies demonstrated the feasibility of ePROs monitoring by thoracic surgery patients and providers. This study will explore barriers to implementation before real-world effectiveness studies."
