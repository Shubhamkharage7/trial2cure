The product formulation in the current study (ST-001) is a phospholipid suspension of nanoparticle sized fenretinide. The current study is a Phase 1 trial in relapsed/refractory (R/R) T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in order to determine the safety profile, pharmacology, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ST-001 nanoFenretinide. Targeted T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-Cell NHL) indications include: (1) Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) including mycosis fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary Syndrome (SS); (2) non-cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (non-CTCL) subtypes: angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) not otherwise specified (NOS); and, follicular T-cell lymphoma (FTCL) as defined in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies."

Patients who have been treated previously with strong CYP3A inducers may enroll in the trial and receive their first dose of ST-001 only after four weeks have elapsed since the last dose of the CYP3A inducer. Strong inducers of human CYP3A include barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, efavirenz, enzalutamide, etravirine, systemic glucocorticoids, mitotane, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, troglitazone as well as the OTC herbal product St John's Wort (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionslabeling/ucm093664.htm#table2-3; http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/it-mmfiles/Cytochrome_P450_3A4_and_3A5_Known_Drug_Interaction_Chart.pdf; http://oncologypro.esmo.org/content/download/66542/1203090/file/CYP3A-inhibitors-inducers-DDI.pdf)\n\nPatients who require concurrent treatment with drugs that are strong to moderate CYP3A inhibitors are excluded from the trial, and patients who have been treated previously with strong CYP3A inhibitors may enroll in the trial and receive their first dose of ST-001 only after four weeks have elapsed since the last dose of the CYP3A inhibitor. This group of inhibitors includes certain antivirals (boceprevir, danoprevir, paritaprevir; elvitegravir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir; ombitasvir, dasabuvir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin) and ciprofloxacin, antifungals (e.g., clotrimazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, voriconazole), aprepitant, cimetidine, cobicistat, conivaptan, crizotinib, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, idelalisib, luvoxamine, imatinib, tofisopam, suboxone and verapamil as well as dietary grapefruit juice and grapefruit (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionslabeling/ucm093664.htm#table2-3; http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/it-mmfiles/Cytochrome_P450_3A4_and_3A5_Known_Drug_Interaction_Chart.pdf; http://oncologypro.esmo.org/content/download/66542/1203090/file/CYP3A-inhibitors-inducers-DDI.pdf)\n\nIf patients being treated with ST-001 require the use of drugs that are either strong inducers of CYP3A or strong to moderate inhibitors of CYP3A to treat a medical condition, all treatment with ST-001 should be discontinued immediately and no further treatment with ST-001 will be allowed.\n\nUse of acetaminophen, cephalosporins and other known hepatotoxic agents is allowed with caution and close monitoring, due to known or potential interaction with ST-001 and potential increased risk of hepatotoxicity\\[52\\]. Patients who require replacement therapy with oral steroids should be allowed to continue the treatment if treatment with stable dose has been initiated more than 2 weeks prior to beginning ST-001 infusion. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/. Medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.\n\nAs part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. Physician investigators should consult the websites listed above for the most current information regarding drug interactions via CYP3A isozymes.\n\nUse of vitamin A supplements is prohibited. Standard multivitamin doses are allowed.\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NY heart classification III/IV), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, QTc interval \\>450 milliseconds on baseline triplicate ECG, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ST-001is a retinoid agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ST-001, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ST-001.\n* HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ST-001. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n* Patients with any active hepatitis infections.\n* Presence of nyctalopia (night blindness), or hemeralopia (defective vision in a bright light, 'day blindness') at enrollment, or any other retinal, ophthalmological condition (eg: retinitis pigmentosa, choroidoretinitis and xerophthalmia), and glaucoma.\n* Patients who have received prior fenretinide systemic therapy\n* Patients with T-cell lymphoma types other than those specified in section 3.1.1 are not eligible even if they have cutaneous dissemination. Similarly, patients with any type of natural killer (NK)- or B-cell lymphoma are not eligible regardless of sites of involvement by disease.",
