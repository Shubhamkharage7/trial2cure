            "briefSummary": "The first aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of delivering CO-OP remotely to individuals experiencing cognitive impairments that limit everyday activities in post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS). The second aim of this study is to assess the effect of CO-OP on activity performance, subjective and objective cognition, and quality of life in a sample of individuals with PCS. The research team hypothesizes that effect size estimations will indicate that CO-OP will have a greater positive effect, compared to an inactive control group, on activity performance, subjective and objective cognition, and quality of life in a sample of individuals who self-report PCS and cognitive impairment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Post-COVID-19 symptoms (PCS) cognitive symptoms require the rehabilitation community to investigate ways to: (1) reduce the functional impact of the symptoms on daily life and (2) support individuals with PCS to establish new habits to improve and maintain health. While the cognitive impairment associated with PCS has not been well evaluated, it is similar of cognitive symptoms seen in other conditions. Metacognitive strategy training (MCST) approaches are an evidence-based practice standard for improving capacity to self-manage chronic cognitive symptoms and reduce their functional impact on everyday life activities.\n\nThe CO-OP approach is an MCST intervention in which participants are taught a general cognitive strategy that can be applied in known and novel contexts to devise task specific strategies for engaging in an activity. Existing evidence with other populations suggests that CO-OP has more of a positive effect on improving activity performance and cognition than remediation/retraining-based approaches. These effects have been demonstrated in individuals with mild cognitive impairment that mirrors that found in PCS. The overall research hypothesis is that CO-OP can feasibly be administered remotely and will improve activity performance, subjective and objective cognitive function, and quality of life in individuals with PCS."

First, five functional, everyday life goals are identified collaboratively by the participant and interventionist. In the second meeting, we introduce the approach to the subject and teach the global cognitive strategy (i.e., GOAL-PLAN-DO-CHECK). In all subsequent sessions, this strategy is used as the main problem-solving framework to facilitate skill acquisition.The subject identifies a GOAL, and then is guided by the therapist to discover a PLAN to potentially achieve the goal. The subject is then asked to DO the plan (if feasible during the therapy session otherwise asked to complete at home prior to the next treatment session), and subsequently to CHECK to see if the plan worked, i.e. the goal was achieved. This process is repeated until satisfactory performance is met for each established goal.",
