Program participants can choose to participate in the research study which will include data collection (surveys, biometrics, basic labs). The data collection will occur at four timepoints - baseline prior to program start, post-program, 3 month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will include 45 subjects recruited from AdventHealth Medical Group in the HEAL Breast Cancer Program that consent to participate in the research study. The research study will include data collection along with the program participation. Patients who decline participation in the research study are able to participate in the HEAL Breast Cancer Program. The program sessions will be conducted virtually via Zoom by Dr. Amber Orman, a breast cancer physician board certified in radiation oncology and lifestyle medicine. There are eight program sessions, one per week, each lasting 90-minutes. The survey package includes nine questionnaires and is expected to take 60 minutes to complete."
