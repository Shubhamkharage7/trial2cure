They want to collect data and specimens from affected people, their family members, and healthy people.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study diseases of the heart and/or blood vessels.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople age 2 and older who may have genetic disease affecting the heart and/or blood vessels Their relatives\n\nHealthy volunteers\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history, physical exams, and imaging tests. Participants may have a few visits or visits for 2 weeks or more. This will depend on their age and disease status. Visits may include:\n\nPhotographs of the face and body\n\nHeart tests\n\nSamples taken of blood, urine, saliva, skin, and/or tissue\n\nScans. For some, a dye may be injected into a vein.\n\nA six-minute walk test\n\nLung tests. For some, participants will blow into a tube. For others, they will breathe in a gas from a mask, have a small injection, then have a scan.\n\nStress tests while walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike\n\nUltrasound of veins and arteries\n\nDevices outside the body testing the stiffness and function of arteries\n\nEye exam and eye tests. For some, a dye may be injected in a vein.\n\nBlood pressure tests\n\nMeasurements of blood flow under the skin and in the arms and fingernail blood vessels\n\nDevices outside the body testing flexibility of the blood vessels and skin, and skin temperature...",
            "detailedDescription": "The NIH provides a unique opportunity for research scientists to participate in the bench-to-bedside process, which is essential for the full implementation of translational medicine programs. The study of rare monogenetic and undiagnosed diseases is a complex bedside-to-bench-to-bedside endeavor. Recent studies show that rare genetic variants are more likely than common variants to have deleterious effects on protein structure, function, and/or expression, possibly leading to clinically relevant events. Studies of large patient populations offer the opportunity to identify rare genetic variants underlying human disease and will have impactful implications for human health. We propose to characterize the etiology and natural history of rare and orphan diseases with vascular phenotypes. We will also study rare genetic modifiers and identify novel disease mechanisms contributing to common vascular diseases. Subsequent disease-related protocols may be developed based on findings from subjects enrolled in this protocol for further intensive natural history studies and potential innovative therapeutic studies. In addition to its role in investigating individuals who are of interest to the Translational Vascular Medicine Branch (TVMB) of the NHLBI, this protocol can provide a possible avenue for admitting subjects from other NIH programs, such as the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the Center for Human Immunology Trans-institute program or other NIH protocols where subjects exhibit vascular phenotypes."
