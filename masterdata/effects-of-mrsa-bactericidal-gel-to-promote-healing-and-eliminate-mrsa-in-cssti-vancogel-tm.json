            "briefSummary": "Based on personal experience and the literature it is reasonable expectation that Vancomycin is a viable treatment in a direct contact form to eliminate MRSA from open wounds in order to heal the wounds by conventional means. The key question in my research has been to measure the effectiveness of my Vancomycin Gel by culturing the wound, applying the Gel in a controlled manner and then culturing the wound after one week. The end point to achieve in the process, is a clinical response of accelerated healing and negative culture report. Another question to solve is the duration of potency and stability of the Vancomycin gel over time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Over a prior preliminary 33 month study I have found negative cultures at the end of one week of treatment and have had microbiological studies establishing the same MIC zones in culture media greater than 15mm over a 33 month time frame. The microbiological and HPLC studies are completed at present and approved. I have started the phase 2 studies on August 1,2011 as authorized by the FDA on June 22,2011."
