The main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n* Will a health program called Living Healthy, which provides health education and support with positive thinking, be used by home health aides and do they like it?\n* Does Living Healthy actually improve home health aides' mood compared to what they usually do to take care of themselves?\n\nParticipants in the study will get an 8-week health program called Living Healthy over 3 months. Some of the participants will also have a 'peer coach' who is another home health aide who's been trained to help them with the program and learn some ways to feel better.\n\nThe study will compare the experiences of home health aides who get Living Healthy plus a peer coach with those who only get the Living Healthy program."

For those in the interventional arm, the Living Healthy intervention program will be delivered by trained peer coaches by telephone or Zoom over 3 months. In this study, trained peer coaches are trained home health aides themselves. Informed by social cognitive theory (SCT), peer coaches train participants on cognitive behavior techniques and empower participants to adopt positive health behaviors through personalized goal setting, motivational interviewing, and peer modeling. Each content-based session incorporates principles of CBT, teaching participants to recognize and modify negative thinking and modifying outcome expectations through self-monitoring, reflection, and practice.",
