The investigators will enroll 21 people with PASC who will be randomized into two conditions with different temperature WBH. The primary aims will explore acceptability and feasibility, reduction of fatigue (primary symptom), and potential mechanisms (inflammation and sleep). Inflammation and sleep have both been shown to be dysregulated in PASC and addressed by WBH in other populations. The investigators will use week 2 as the primary endpoint. However, patients will be followed for 4 weeks to monitor the duration of effect."

Morbid obesity (BMI \\> 40) and/or body shape that might increase the risk of cutaneous burning from the device (because of skin being too close to the heat).\n9.

Breast Implants\n11. Claustrophobia that would interfere with ability to remain in sauna\n12. Fever (Temp \\> 99 degrees Fahrenheit) of unknown origin at the time of screening\n13.
