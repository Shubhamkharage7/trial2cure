            "briefSummary": "Older sepsis survivors have poor physical function and need post-sepsis physical rehabilitation. Often times, sepsis survivors live far from research facilities and do not have access to rehabilitation services. Remotely delivered exercise intervention could be the key to improve physical function in this population. Therefore, the study proposes to recruit older sepsis survivors at discharge from the hospital to home and assign them to either exercise training or standard care.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed research will use a multi-disciplinary expertise of the University of Florida Sepsis and Critical Illness Research Center (SCIRC). For this project, the investigators will take advantage of the SCIRC's ongoing recruitment and monitoring of sepsis patients into an observational 1-year follow-up study. For this pilot, the investigators will approach and screen older sepsis survivors who get discharged from hospital to home. Potential participants will be approached within 5 days before discharge. The study will enroll 40 low-functioning (SPPB \\<6) older sepsis patients (\u226555 years old). The enrolled subjects will be randomized to either digitally delivered and home-based exercise training program or standard care control group. All participants will receive tablets with the Blue Marble Health Platform (BMHP) app. For the control group, the app will be enabled only for the physical function assessments and for the rest of the time, only a health diary for logging daily activities will be available. Both groups will receive weekly phone calls from our research staff member to ask about their health and remind them of weekly charging of their tablets. The intervention group will receive daily reminders by text to perform the exercises for 30 min daily 5 days/week. Participants will be given wrist fitness tracking watches with step-counting and heart rate to measure adherence to an exercise intervention. At baseline and 12-week follow-up visits physical function assessments will be app-guided using the BMHP-validated physical function test similar to SPPB, with a blinded coordinator present via a video call to assist a participant with answering questions about the tests. The interventionists who will be calling the participants will be trained to maintain the same level of rapport to not jeopardize the study conditions."
