            "detailedDescription": "The Launching! to Adulthood (\u00a1Iniciando! la Adultez) program uses a culturally sensitive therapy program that was translated into Spanish to help Latino young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who are transitioning to adulthood (18-25 years old) and their parents. The program aims to make the transition to adulthood easier for young adults and their families, and it includes specific cultural values of Latino young adults and their family members. The \u00a1Iniciando! la adultez program helps autistic young adults manage mental health needs like depression and anxiety and also addresses several areas impacting transition, including mental health barriers, executive functioning, and motivation. The \u00a1Iniciando! program also helps parents manage their own needs and addresses several areas, including psychoeducation and mental health."

After a combined (parents and young adults) 90-minute introductory group meeting in-person, parents and the transition-aged young adults with ASD attend 9 separate, 90-minute weekly group telehealth meetings. Additionally, young adults have weekly personal coaching meetings for 30-minutes to discuss progress toward goals and barriers encountered. Leaders teach transition-aged young adult's skills through various social activities, as well as other skills (e.g., emotion regulation, cognitive diffusion) to help overcome barriers towards their goals. The treatment targets three core factors (i.e., mental health conditions, social skills, and coping with and adapting to stress). Leaders teach parents new parenting skills, knowledge of ASD, and readiness to support their young adult's transition to independent life.",
