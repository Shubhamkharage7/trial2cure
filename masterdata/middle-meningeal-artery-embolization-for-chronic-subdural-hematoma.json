            "briefSummary": "Endovascular middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization is an emerging treatment for chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). There is preliminary data to suggest that this minimally invasive therapy may be more efficacious and equally as safe compared to conventional, more invasive surgery. This study seeks to assess the safety and efficacy of middle meningeal artery embolization for chronic subdural hematoma as an adjunct to standard treatments, which include medical management and surgical evacuation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study seeks to assess the safety and efficacy of middle meningeal artery embolization for chronic subdural hematoma in addition to standard treatments, which include close observation and surgical evacuation. Middle meningeal artery embolization has emerged recently as a minimally invasive and successful method of preventing re-accumulation of subdural hematoma, particularly for patients that are not obvious surgical candidates or those with recurrent or refractory hematomas. The outcomes of these two groups of patients who undergo middle meningeal artery embolization will be compared to matched historical controls.\n\nMiddle meningeal artery embolization is a minimally invasive angiography procedure completed with use of fluoroscopy. Access is obtained through the femoral or radial artery and a catheter is advanced to the MMA. Polyvinyl alcohol particles are then injected to seal off this portion of the artery and prevent any further blood flow into the subdural hematoma. Hemostasis is obtained at the access site and the patient is observed for 24-48 hours on a neurological care unit before discharge.\n\nA head CT, NIHSS, and modified Rankin Score will be repeated on the following schedule: \u2022 Pre-Procedure\n\n* 24 hours post procedure\n* 7-10 days post procedure\n* 30 days post procedure\n* 90 days post procedure\n\nPatients with chronic subdural hematoma undergo CT scans and neurologic assessments on hospital admission, as well as follow up CT scans and neurologic assessments to assess for any change in neurologic status or hematoma size. This study utilizes a standard of care follow up schedule to avoid exposing participants to extra radiation. Participants will be followed for study related purposes for 90 days."
