            "briefSummary": "To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a novel suture-less drain securement device (K-Lock) via direct comparison to suture-based techniques. In this study the suture-less drain securement device will be compared to the use of sutures to secure drains. One will be secured with the K-Lock and the other will be secured with sutures.",
            "detailedDescription": "Patients will be randomized to either A) left side K-Lock with right side suture-based technique or B) right side K-Lock with left side suture-based technique. Randomization will occur before study initiation with group A or group B being assigned to a study enrollment number.\n\nPreoperatively:\n\nThe novel suture-less prototype device will be described and/or demonstrated to the patients, and the rationale for its development will be explained. They will have opportunity to ask questions and then they will be invited to participate in the study.\n\nWritten informed consent will be obtained.\n\nIntraoperatively:\n\nSurgical drains will be placed per the usual routine of the surgeon. Definitive drain fixation will occur when all of the pertinent incisions are closed and dressed. At that time, each drain will be secured according to the randomization scheme.\n\nThe amount of time it takes to secure and dress each drain will be recorded using a time-stamped video (e.g. iphone).\n\nPostoperatively:\n\nThe time until drain removal will be recorded for both groups.\n\nOn postoperative visit(s) on which a drain is removed, patients will complete a survey about their experience with the pertinent securement method/drain site.\n\nFeasibility and ease of use of the novel drain device will be evaluated by evaluation of video recordings, qualitative feedback obtained from surgeons and/or O.R staff and nurses that handle and observe use of the device.\n\nSafety of the novel drain device will be evaluated by inspecting device sites for signs of skin injury at each office visit and at the time of drain removal, including photographs of drain sites immediately before and after removal. It will also be assessed by feedback obtained in the patient surveys."
