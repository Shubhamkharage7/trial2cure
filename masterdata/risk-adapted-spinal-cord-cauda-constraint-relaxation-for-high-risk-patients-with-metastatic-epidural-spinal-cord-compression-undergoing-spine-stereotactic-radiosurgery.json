Specifically, we aim to maintain an RM risk no greater than 1%. RM will be defined as non-functional paresis per the McCormick score (i.e., Grade D).\n\nSecondary Objectives Secondary objectives include pain control as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D, symptom burden as measured by the MDASI-SP, overall survival, toxicity, ambulatory rate and cost-effectiveness. LC will be defined radiographically with serial MRI scans by the study radiologist per SPINO criteria."
