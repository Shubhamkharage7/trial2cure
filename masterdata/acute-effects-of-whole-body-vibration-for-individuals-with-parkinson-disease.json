            "detailedDescription": "This study will provide valuable information towards the relationship between backward walking using the 3-minute backward walk test and whole body vibration (WBV). The 3MBWT has shown to have diagnostic accuracy for fall prediction in older adults. The 3MBWT has been found to be feasible within the acute stroke population. In a study, the 3MBWT revealed that in the geriatric population a score of more than 4.5 seconds were likely to report a fall history. Gait parameters including a decrease in gait velocity (p\\<0.01) have been found to worsen while performing dual tasks (serial-7 subtraction) in individuals with PD. Research has shown when compared to other cognitive tests, the \"serial sevens\" tests increased the time required to perform the Timed Up and Go in individuals with PD.\n\nThis study will use a control group performing mid-squats on level ground and an intervention group performing mid-squats on a WBV machine. Each group will perform 5 sets of mid-squats for 60 seconds with a 60 second rest period between each set. Pre and post testing will involve three trials of the 3MBWT.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the immediate impact of WBV on backward walking velocity in individuals diagnosed with PD."
