            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the clinical performance of the Medaxis debritom+ versus standard of care (sharp debridement using scalpel) in the real world practice of wound care management in a single center trial by collecting data on wound healing rates over time, success of advanced wound care treatments, and downstream financial costs in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, dehisced surgical wounds and traumatic wounds. Medaxis debritom+TM is an advanced micro fluid jet FDA registered Class II device, which will be used within the cleared intended use of wound therapy."

All wounds using the Sandy Grading System, except those in the exclusion criteria. (See Appendix A for definitions)\n\n    Traumatic\n16. All wounds as per the CDC Surgical Wound Classification, with the exception of Class IV or dirty infected wounds, SSI - Deep incisional and organ space. (See Appendix A for definitions)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nGeneral\n\nPotential subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment and subsequent randomization:\n\n1. The index wound, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer or have a positive carcinoma diagnosis.\n2. Subject has a history of more than two weeks of treatment with immune-suppressants (including systemic corticosteroids \\>10mg daily dose), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of topical steroids to the wound surface within 1 month prior to first SV1, or who receive such medications during the screening period or who are anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study.\n3. Subject is taking a selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as Celecoxib, for any condition.\n4. Subject is on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days preceding SV1.\n5. History of radiation at the wound site (regardless of time since last radiation treatment).\n6. Index wound has been previously treated or will need to be treated with any prohibited therapies (See Section 6 of this protocol for a list of prohibited medications and therapies).\n7. Subject has a previous diagnosis of HIV, Hepatitis C, or other contagious diseases.\n8. Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to complete this study or the subject has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.\n9. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n10. Presence of diabetes with poor metabolic control as documented with an HbA1c \\>12.0 % within 90 days of randomization.\n11. Subject has end-stage renal disease as evidenced by a serum creatinine \\> 3.0mg/dL within 6 months of randomization.\n12. BMI \\>55\n13. PAR experiences a \\>30% change between SV1 and SV2 DFU\n14. Wagner 2 wounds that require debridement of bone.\n15. Osteomyelitis or bone infection of the affected foot as verified by x-ray, CAT Scan, or MRI within 30 days prior to randomization (In the event of an ambiguous diagnosis, the Principal Investigator will make the final decision).\n\n    VLU\n16. Exclude\n\n    1. Secondary post thrombotic\n    2. Venous Obstruction\n    3. Venous Obstruction with reflux\n    4. Lipodermato sclerosis or atrophic blanche\n17.
