During the escalation part, groups of participants will receive increasing doses of HFB200301 as a monotherapy or in combination with tislelizumab until a safe and tolerable dose of HFB200301 as a single agent or combination therapy is determined. During the expansion part, participants will take the dose of HFB200301 as a monotherapy or in combination with tislelizumab that was determined from the escalation part of the study and will be assigned to a group based on the type of cancer the participants have.",
