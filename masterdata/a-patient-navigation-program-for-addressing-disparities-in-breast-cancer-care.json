The navigation program is designed to help improve patient knowledge about clinical and supportive care services, navigate to existing services, help manage barriers to care, and enhance patient skills related to management of cancer treatment. Offering a patient navigation program may increase health equity and improve social needs and quality of life over time for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.",

Implement a patient navigation program in the Roswell Park Breast Clinic focused on underserved women with a first cancer diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n=126).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Systematically address barriers to care by connecting women with multiple barriers of care with a first diagnosis of breast cancer or DCIS to supportive services and culturally appropriate resources."
