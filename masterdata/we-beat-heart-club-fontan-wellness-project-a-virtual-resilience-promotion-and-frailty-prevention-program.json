The first phase is the \"WE BEAT Group Wellness Education Program\" and participants will be transitioned into the phase two HEART Club following phase one.\n\nThe trial will look at feasibility and acceptability of the program. Additional hypothesis include home whether exercise interventions can:\n\n* be delivered without any associated serious cardiac events;\n* will result in a decreased proportion of patients who are categorized as frail when compared to the cohort's pre-test baseline.\n* will result in increased measured peak oxygen consumption when compared with their pre-intervention baseline.\n* will result in increased step counts measured monthly from baseline to end of intervention\n* will improve self-reported quality of life from baseline to post-intervention.\n* will result in increased patient reported activity level from baseline to post-intervention"

Once the program is designed, participants will complete the exercise activities in the plan. Over time, participants will advance through various stages in the program and then will be gradually introduced to the principles of exercise rehabilitation and more intense physical exercise. Participants will be asked to wear a wearable activity tracker and have scheduled video check-ins with the exercise physiology team.
