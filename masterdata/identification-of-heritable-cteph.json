Detailed family history interviews will be performed with all patients, and all enrolled patients will provide a blood sample for thrombophilia testing and for gene sequencing with the goal of identifying novel genetic variants that contribute to CTEPH risk."

PE diagnosed by CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation/perfusion scan within the preceding 24 months.\n  2. No evidence of PH at the time of enrollment (based on absence of dyspnea, exertional chest pain, or exertional presyncope on history, lack of physical exam findings of PH or right heart failure, and lack of signs of PH on objective data including echocardiography and/or right heart catheterization).\n  3. No evidence of chronic thromboembolic disease at the time of enrollment (based on chronic appearing thrombus on CT pulmonary angiography or conventional pulmonary angiography, or based on prior high probability ventilation/perfusion scan showing a similar pattern of perfusion defects).\n* PAH cohort:\n\n  1. Diagnosis of group 1 PAH.\n  2. Prior normal or low probability ventilation/perfusion scan.\n  3. No reported history of prior VTE events.\n  4. If available, all prior evaluations for VTE (including CT pulmonary angiography and Doppler ultrasound exams) must also be negative.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Under the age of 18",
