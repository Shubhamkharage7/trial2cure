The time in the study will take approximately four to six hours during pre-study, study and end of study visits.",
            "detailedDescription": "Treatment will continue until participants experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdraws consent and will include chemoradiation (28 days) followed by FOLFOXIRI x 8 cycles (16 weeks). A cycle is defined as an interval of fourteen days, except for Cycle 1 spanning fourteen days which includes eight cycles of FOLFOXIRI treatment prior to surgery. For participants experiencing unacceptable FOLFOXIRI or chemoradiation related toxicity, yet obtaining therapeutic benefit, participants will be allowed to continue treatment, if well tolerated at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nUpon discontinuation of study treatment, participants will receive safety follow-up assessments approximately 30 and 90 days later. Once the 90-day safety follow-up is complete, participants will enter the survival follow-up period where they will continue to be followed approximately every three months until death, withdrawal of consent, or overall study completion. Patients will be followed for survival for 36 months from enrollment."
