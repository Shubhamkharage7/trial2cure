Patients in each treatment group (surgery or laser) will be randomized 2:1 at the time of surgery/laser to receive either:\n\n1. Treatment Arm: Dextenza insert intraoperatively for perioperative ocular inflammation and pain. These patients will not be prescribed topical steroid drops post-operatively, or\n2. Control Arm: Prednisolone forte 1% steroid drop taper for 28 days post-operatively to treat perioperative ocular inflammation and pain; drops four times per day (QUID) on days 0-7, three times per day (TID) on days 7-14, twice per day (BID) on days 14-21 and once per day (QD) on days 21-28.\n\nEach treatment group (surgery or laser) will include 15 patients total, 10 receiving Dextenza and 5 receiving the control drug. Drops for dilation and antibiotic coverage will be used as clinically indicated in all groups throughout the study period. Follow up will occur at post-op day 1, 7, 28/30 and 45 ( +/- three days for all post-operative timepoints)."
