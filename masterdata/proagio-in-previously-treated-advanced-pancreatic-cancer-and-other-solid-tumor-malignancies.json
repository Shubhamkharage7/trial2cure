The median overall survival for patients with metastatic disease who are receiving the most effective combination of chemotherapy regimens remains less than 1 year.\n\nProAgio has been evaluated in nonclinical pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicity studies. It has demonstrated efficacy at treating pancreatic cancer and prolonging survival in mice.\n\nProAgio is being developed for intravenous (IV) administration. All participants will receive ProAgio until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from study. Subjects in the dose escalation cohorts who will be administered ProAgio at doses ranging from 3.2 to 36.8 mg/kg.\n\nFollowing the dose escalation phase, an expansion cohort of patients with advanced nonendocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be administered ProAgio at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the dose escalation phase. The expansion cohort will comprise 16 subjects, divided into two blocks (n=8 each) of patients who agree to have optional pre and post-treatment biopsies, and those who decline the optional biopsies."

Participants must be more than 14 days removed from most recent standard of care or experimental drug treatment for their tumor\n* Participants in the dose escalation cohort must have evaluable disease, either by clinical exam, biochemical markers (including but not limited to CA 19-9 serum tumor marker for pancreatobiliary cancer participants, or other appropriate tumor marker in other tumor types), and/or radiographic studies.\n* Participants in the expansion cohort must have measurable disease, per RECIST 1.1.\n* Age \\>18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of ProAgio in participants \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.\n* ECOG performance status \\<2 (Karnofsky \\>60%.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count \\>1,000 mcl\n  * hemoglobin \\>9 g/dl\n  * platelets \\>75,000/mcl\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \\< 2.5 x ULN.

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for the 3 months following the last dosing of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of primary malignant CNS tumor.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including but not limited to significant pulmonary disease other than that related to the primary cancer, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, unstable angina, significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease) and/or psychiatric illness/social situations within 12 weeks that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Participants with known diagnosis of a chronic neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, or uncontrolled epilepsy) which causes motor disturbance, visual disturbance or seizure and could confound assessment of neurologic toxicity caused by the study drug.\n* Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because ProAgio is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ProAgio, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ProAgio.\n* Participants with leptomeningeal disease or with CNS metastases that are untreated, have required steroid treatment within the last 4 weeks, or anti-convulsant therapy in the last 14 days.

Patents on appropriate highly active anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load are eligible.\n* Participants with a history of Hepatitis B or C are excluded unless there is documented evidence of effective treatment and/or cure with undetectable viral load.\n* Participants with recent (within \\< 28 days) thromboembolic disease including but not limited to acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischemic attack, recent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism are excluded.\n* Participants with thromboembolic disease including but not limited to acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischemic attack, recent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who have continued symptoms, or who are not on stable doses of appropriate antiplatelet / anticoagulant regimens are excluded.",
