            "briefSummary": "This study has two phases, Phase I and Phase II. The main goal of the Phase I portion of this research study is to see what doses post-transplant inotuzumab ozogamicin can safely be given to subjects without having too many side effects.\n\nThe Phase II portion of this study is to see what side effects are seen with medication after transplant.\n\nInotuzumab ozogamicin is a combination of an antibody and chemotherapy which has been shown to have significant activity against relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).\n\nInotuzumab ozogamicin is considered experimental in this study.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Design This is a Phase I/II study of inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation for ALL and have a high risk of relapse. The Phase I portion of this study will be a 3+3 dose escalation trial. This is followed by a phase 2 cohort at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Participants will receive study treatment up to 4 cycles until relapse of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurs first\n\nPhase I: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Dosing Escalation Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach.\n\nPhase II: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach. In order to be included in the safety profile endpoint review, subjects must have received at least of 1 cycle of treatment.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nPhase I: To define a post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of inotuzumab ozogamicin.\n\nPhase II: To assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured by diseasefree survival (DFS) at one year.\n\nSecondary Objective(s)\n\nPhase I:\n\n* To evaluate disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, relapse-related mortality and overall survival (OS) at 1 year.\n* To determine safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin after transplant including the incidence of myeloid toxicity and secondary graft failure and the rate of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS).\n* To determine if inotuzumab ozogamicin at these doses is effective at eradicating minimal residual disease in this cohort of participants\n\nPhase II:\n\n* To assess additional evidence of efficacy and safety as measured by non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse, relapse-related mortality and overall survival (OS) at 1 year.\n* To determine if inotuzumab ozogamicin at these doses is effective at eradicating MRD.\n* To confirm the safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy after transplant including myeloid toxicity, secondary graft failure, and the rate of VOD/SOS.\n* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab ozogamicin post allogeneic transplant"
