As such, the following is an investigator-initiated trial to determine whether application of a topical hemostatic agent reduces sternal bleeding during cardiac surgery using sternotomy approach.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective randomized 1:1 trial to evaluate the efficacy of the application of HEMOBLASTTM during cardiothoracic surgery to reduce the increased risk of sternal bleeding in 30 treatment and 30 control patients.\n\nEnrollment will be open to all eligible participants undergoing cardiothoracic surgery who sign an informed consent.\n\nThe study will also collect demographic data and relevant clinical data, such as medical history, diagnosis, family history, laboratory data, radiological images and reports, and diagnostic procedure reports.\n\nAll enrolled subjects will be followed during their hospitalization until discharge for bleeding complications after their surgical procedure as well as a sternal bleeding SPOT GRADE TM score will be recorded independently by both the cardiac surgeon and assisting cardiothoracic PA-C, before and after the application of the topical hemostatic agent. There will be no restriction on the use of electrocautery or vancomycin paste as existing routine adjuncts used in cardiothoracic surgery for sternal hemostasis. Chest tube output measurements will be collected at 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The patients will be assessed at the time of hospital discharge for any complications related to sternal or intrathoracic bleeding."
