Once all the subjects complete the 52 weeks Observation Period, the treatment groups will be unblinded and primary analysis performed. Study participation duration: The study will last 52 weeks from dosing, with another 4 years of long-term follow-up for a total of 5 years. During the 4 year long-term follow up sites will contact subjects twice a year for two years, then once a year for the remaining two years for safety, efficacy assessments, and survival"

Clinically significant myocardial infarction (MI) in the judgment of the subject's physician (e.g., ST elevation MI \\[STEMI\\] or large non-STEMI) within 6 months prior to enrollment\n15. Prior heart transplantation, left ventricular reduction surgery (LVRS), cardiomyoplasty, passive restraint device (e.g., CorCap\u2122 Cardiac Support Device), surgically implanted LVAD or cardiac shunt\n16. Likely to receive cardiac resynchronization therapy, cardiomyoplasty, LV reduction surgery, heart transplant, conventional revascularization procedure, or valvular repair within 3 months of IP dosing in judgement of investigator.\n17. Known hypersensitivity to contrast dyes (not easily controlled by antihistamines) used for angiography; history of, or likely need for, high-dose steroid pretreatment prior to contrast angiography.\n18. Expected survival \\< 1 year in the judgment of the investigator\n19. Active or suspected infection within 48 hours prior to intra-coronary infusion as evidenced by fever or positive culture\n20. Known intrinsic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis A, chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection). If serology is positive and PCR is known to be negative, subject may be eligible (confirm with medical monitor).\n21. Liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\], aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\], alkaline phosphatase) \\> 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 30 days prior to enrollment.\n22. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5, dialysis dependent or eGFR\\<15 within 30 days prior to enrollment\n23. Bleeding diathesis or thrombocytopenia defined as platelets \\<50,000 platelets/\u03bcL within 30 days prior to enrollment\n24. Anemia defined as hemoglobin \\<10 g/dL or transfusion dependent within 30 days prior to enrollment\n25. Neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophils \\<1500 mm3 within 30 days prior to enrollment\n26. Known AIDS or HIV-positive status, or a previous diagnosis of immunodeficiency with an absolute neutrophil count \\<1000 cells/mm3\n27. Previous participation in a study of gene transfer\n28. Receiving investigational intervention or participating in another clinical study within 30 days of another investigational drug administration prior to administration of AB-1002 that may impact the therapeutic potential of AB-1002.\n29. Pregnancy or breastfeeding or plans to become pregnant within the next 12 months at the time of screening\n30. Subjects with any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the study (including risk for non-compliance and any intercurrent conditions that pose an undue medical hazard, or which could interfere with the interpretation of the study results)\n31. Malignant neoplasm within 5 years of dosing, with the exception of those with negligible risk of metastasis or death (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situs of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ)\n32.
