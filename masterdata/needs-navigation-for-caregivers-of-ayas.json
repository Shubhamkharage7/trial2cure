            "briefSummary": "The overall aim of the study is to address unmet health-related social needs and reduce outcome disparities among AYA cancer survivors. Aim 1 aimed to refine a needs navigation model in partnership with expert consultants. Aim 2 and 3 will involve the deployment and pilot testing of the adapted needs navigation intervention among caregivers of younger AYAs with cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "Financial toxicity, the negative personal financial impact of healthcare,13 is a highly prevalent adverse effect of cancer treatment, and AYA cancer survivors experience disproportionately higher rates of financial toxicity compared to older cancer survivors. Financial toxicity is associated with poorer overall survival and bankruptcy, and AYA survivors are 10 times more likely to file for bankruptcy than older cancer survivors. Thus, financial toxicity and unmet HRSN (health-related social needs) are key contributors to employment and health outcome disparities seen among AYA survivors living in areas of persistent poverty.\n\nOur team has focused on addressing unmet HRSN and reducing outcome disparities among AYA cancer survivors, many of whom live in areas of persistent poverty. We have adapted a model of financial navigation that reduces financial toxicity among older adults with cancer, informed by qualitative research among Spanish- and English-speaking AYAs and their caregivers from our local community.\n\nWe have identified community and clinical partners poised to address these unique unmet needs. These partners have expertise in educational navigation and caregiver community resources - both cited as unmet needs in our pilot study. Using mixed methods, we will refine (Aim 1 - already completed) and pilot test (Aims 2 and 3) a tailored version of our intervention among 30 English and Spanish-speaking caregivers of younger AYAs who screen positive for severe financial toxicity or unmet HRSN."
