Randomization means that participants are put into a group by chance.\n\nStudy procedures includes screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), blood tests, and questionnaires.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and Claflin Grant are supporting this research by providing funding for the research study."
