Participants will be blinded to which arm they have been randomized to until after surgery.\n\nAll study participants will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their total knee arthroplasty. Investigators will collect clinical data for up to 5 years; follow-up clinic visits will occur at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after surgery.\n\nA maximum of 10 sites will contribute to this study. There will be a maximum of 300 participants enrolled (150 Cementless, 150 Cemented)."
