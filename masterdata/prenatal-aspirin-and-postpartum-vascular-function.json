            "briefSummary": "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy disorder affecting \\~5-10% of pregnancies in the United States. Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are more likely to develop and die of cardiovascular disease later in life, even if they are otherwise healthy. The reason why this occurs is unclear but may be related to blood vessel damage and increased inflammation that occurs during the preeclamptic pregnancy and persists postpartum. Low dose aspirin (LDA; 75-150mg/daily) is currently the most effective and clinically accepted therapy for reducing preeclampsia prevalence in women at high risk for developing the syndrome. The purpose of this study is to interrogate the mechanisms by which LDA therapy mitigates persistent vascular dysfunction in postpartum women who have had preeclampsia.\n\nIn this study, the investigators use the blood vessels in the skin as a representative vascular bed for examining mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction in humans. Using a minimally invasive technique (intradermal microdialysis for the local delivery of pharmaceutical agents) they examine the blood vessels in a dime-sized area of the skin in women who have had a history of preeclampsia. As a compliment to these measurements, they also draw blood from the subjects and isolate the inflammatory cells."
