            "detailedDescription": "Proposed is the development of two versions of the 'ability to resist' drinking model designed to screen AUD medications. Model 1 will examine the impact of alcohol cues and alcohol availability on the 'ability to resist' drinking and subsequent ad-lib drinking. Model 2 (alcohol cues \\& alcohol availability + low dose prime) on the 'ability to resist' drinking and subsequent ad-lib drinking.\n\nThis study will consist of an intake session, a physical exam, and two laboratory sessions. Each laboratory session will start with the presentation of the primes for Model 1 or 2, following which, participants will have the option of initiating an alcohol self-administration session or delaying initiation by five-minute increments for up to 50 minutes in exchange for monetary reinforcement. Subsequently, the alcohol self-administration session entails a 2-hour period in which participants can choose to drink their preferred beverage or receive monetary compensation for alcohol not consumed.\n\nThe primary outcome measures for Aim 1 is the latency to start drinking (i.e., ability to resist drinking) and amount consumed during the self-administration sessions."
