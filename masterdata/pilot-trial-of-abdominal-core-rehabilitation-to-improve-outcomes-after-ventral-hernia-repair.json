Immediately after their surgical procedure, patients will be randomized in a single-blind manner (investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to supervised physical therapy (8 weeks, twice weekly) or standard post-surgical precautions. Assessments and surveys will be repeated by the blinded investigator at 30 days, 10 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery."
