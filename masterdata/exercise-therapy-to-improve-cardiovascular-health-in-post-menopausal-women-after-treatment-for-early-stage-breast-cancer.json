            "briefSummary": "This study will compare the effects on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of aerobic exercise in different amounts (number of minutes/session) over different periods of time (number of weeks). Aerobic exercise is physical activity of light-to-moderate intensity that uses the large muscle groups (muscles in your legs, buttocks, back, and chest) and can be performed for at least 10 minutes.\n\nThe researchers will study the effects of different exercise programs on how well the study participants' bodies use oxygen, how well their heart pumps blood, how well their lungs function, and how healthy their blood vessels are.",
            "detailedDescription": "Prior to the initiation of every supervised aerobic training session, patient resting vital signs will be assessed to ensure the patient can safely proceed with the session. Vital signs, including resting heart rate and blood pressure, will be collected and monitored per ExOnc program guidelines. In addition, the planned session will not be initiated if the ExOnc staff member observes any concerns that may compromise participant safety and/or the integrity of the planned session. Vital sign monitoring guidelines for unsupervised sessions, prescribed at lower intensities, will be advised by the exercise physiologist at the time the session plan is provided to the patient. Patients will be instructed to not begin an unsupervised session if their resting heart rate or blood pressure is outside the recommended guidelines."
