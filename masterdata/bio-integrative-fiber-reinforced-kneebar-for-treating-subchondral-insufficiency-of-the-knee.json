Our hypothesis is that the use of OSSIOfiber\u00ae Trimmable Fixation Nails for treating subchondral insufficiency of the knee will result in improvement of patient-reported outcomes and imaging findings. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of implanting bio-integrative OSSIOfiber\u00ae Trimmable Fixation Nails, organized in a bi-cortical rafter formation within the tibia or femur for the management of subchondral insufficiency. This use is not considered off-label because we are using the TFNs in the way they are intended to be used via FDA approval."
