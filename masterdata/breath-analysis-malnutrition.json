The procedures involved in this study include blood and breath sampling, questionnaires about health history, medications, nutritional status and diet, and a physical examination. Breath markers will be compared between individuals with and without malnutrition and be compared to indicators of malnutrition. Some individuals will undergo an interventional study involving 2 days of consuming study beverages and fasting along with providing additional breath samples to see if the breath changes in response to short-term changes in nutritional status.",
            "detailedDescription": "Research Summary: This research involves a cross-sectional study investigating whether breath molecules (in particular ammonia and nitric oxide) are related to the presence and magnitude of malnutrition as measured by the gold-standard nutrition focused physical examination (NFPE). It also involves an interventional study in a subset of cross-sectional participants looking at whether acute changes in nutritional status through anabolic feeding protocols or fasting protocols is related to short term changes in breath molecules.\n\nPurpose of the Research: The purpose is to identify early evidence of breath biomarkers of malnutrition. It uses a combination of breath analysis and current malnutrition screening tools (questionnaires)."
