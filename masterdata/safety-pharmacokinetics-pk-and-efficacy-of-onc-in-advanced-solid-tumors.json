            "detailedDescription": "ONC-841 is an investigational drug being developed as an anti-tumor treatment. ONC-841 is an antibody drug that binds to immune cells inside the tumor mass. The target molecule is Siglec10, mostly expressed on neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. ONC-841 binds to Siglec10 to block the \"do not eat me\" signals that cancer cells give to immune system, which allow macrophages and neutrophils to \"eat\" the tumor cells. The study will use ONC-841 alone for cancer treatment. The study will evaluate seven dose levels of ONC-841 starting from 0.03 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg, given once every 4 weeks."
