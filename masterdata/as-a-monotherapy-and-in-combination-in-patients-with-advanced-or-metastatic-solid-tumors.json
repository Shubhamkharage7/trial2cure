The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 138 patients in dose escalation, and approximately 113 participants in the dose expansion phase. Participants will receive escalating doses of DCSZ11 and a fixed dose of pembrolizumab until DCSZ11 doses for phase 1b are selected:\n\n* Phase 1a DCSZ11 monotherapy Dose Escalation.\n* Phase 1a DCSZ11 in combination with fixed dose of pembrolizumab Dose Escalation.\n\nOnce Phase 1b doses are selected for Phase 1b, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will receive DCSZ11 in below defined cohorts in Phase 1b:\n\n* Phase 1b cohort 1 NSCLC.\n* Phase 1b cohort 2 Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC) without liver involvement.\n* Phase 1b cohort 3 MSS-CRC with liver involvement.\n\nThis multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is 60 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and survival follow-up for a maximum of up to 12 months after the last dose of the study drug."

History of autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy with daily doses of prednisone \\>10 mg/day or equivalent doses, or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy. Hormone therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered an excluded form of systemic treatment of an autoimmune disease.\n   3. History of noninfectious pneumonitis that required steroids or a history of interstitial lung disease.\n   4. Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis.\n   5. History of allogeneic tissue or solid organ transplant.\n10.
