            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center, investigator-initiated study to determine if the type of catheter used to deliver the radiotracer in the mapping procedure improves the delivery of radioactive microspheres during radioembolization treatment for liver cancer.\n\nBoth catheters being used, the Pressure Enabled Drug Delivery (PEDD)/TriNav Infusion System and theStandard 2.4F microcatheter have been cleared for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nRadioembolization for the treatment of liver tumors typically requires 2 separate procedures. The first procedure is called the mapping procedure. During the mapping procedure, the blood supply to the liver and tumor are evaluated with a type of x-ray called angiography. Once the optimal catheter position is determined for treatment, a \"simulation\" run is performed with the injection of a fluid that acts like the radiation that will be delivered to treat the tumors. This fluid is called a radiotracer. The study is looking to learn if the Pressure Enabled Drug Delivery device increases the ratio of radiotracer delivered to liver tumor tissue relative to normal liver tissue compared to a standard microcatheter. An improved delivery of radiotracer may indicate improved delivery of radioactive microspheres which may lead to improved tumor response rates and less liver toxicity\n\nThe research study procedures include assessments for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations, and follow-up visits.\n\nParticipants will undergo the study procedures in the normal course of their radioembolization procedure, with the addition of a second mapping procedure on the treatment day. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two mapping procedures: Sequence A or Sequence B.\n\nIt is expected that about 10-20 people in total will take part in this research study.\n\nTriSalus Life Sciences, Inc., a biotechnology and medical device company, is supporting this research study by providing funding."
