            "detailedDescription": "PC14586 (INN: rezatapopt) is a first-in-class, oral, small molecule p53 reactivator that is selective for the TP53 Y220C mutation.\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 Monotherapy is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PC14586 (INN: rezatapopt). Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, safety and tolerability, and to assess preliminary efficacy including overall response rate (ORR).\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1b Combination Therapy is to establish the MTD/RP2D of PC14586 (INN: rezatapopt) when administered in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives of Phase 1b Combination Therapy are to characterize PK, safety and tolerability, and to assess preliminary efficacy of PC14586 (INN: rezatapopt) when administered in combination with pembrolizumab, including ORR.\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 2 Monotherapy is to evaluate the efficacy of PC14586 (INN: rezatapopt) at the RP2D including the ORR in the Ovarian Cancer Cohort and the ORR across all cohorts as determined by blinded independent central review. Secondary objectives of Phase 2 are to characterize the safety, PK properties, quality of life, and other efficacy measures of PC14586 (INN: rezatapopt) at the RP2D."
