            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether prevention education using motivational interviewing focused on promoting positive maternal mental health, coping with inconsolable crying, life stress reduction, and positive coping strategies with difficult infant behavior can provide complimentary messaging that supports positive parental behavior and reduces risks associated with poor mental health and infant maltreatment. The goal is to examine the efficacy of the Parenting Action Plan (PAP), a booklet with information that focuses on sleep hygiene, soothing a crying baby, what to do when the baby's crying is overwhelming, identifying safe caregivers in case of emergency, and issues surrounding feeding and bonding with the baby. It is delivered using motivational interviewing techniques. This study is not designed to develop education for \"at-risk\" individuals, rather the purpose is to develop a populationlevel prevention program."
