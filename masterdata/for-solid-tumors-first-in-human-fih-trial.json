All participants will receive active drug; no one will be given placebo.",

The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation part (\"escalation\" - phase 1) and an expansion part (\"expansion\" - phase 2a). The goal of the dose escalation part is to find out if GEN1047 is safe in participants with specific solid tumors and to find the best dose(s). In the expansion part of the trial up to two doses of GEN1047 will be tested."
