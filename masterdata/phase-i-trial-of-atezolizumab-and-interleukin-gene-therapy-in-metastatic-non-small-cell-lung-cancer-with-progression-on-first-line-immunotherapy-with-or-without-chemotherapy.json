Approximately 16 patients will be enrolled on the study. The primary endpoint will be the safety of the atezolizumab and ADV/IL-12 gene therapy combination and will be determined using the Bayesian model averaging-continual reassessment method (BMA-CRM). ADV/IL-12 will be intratumorally injected on Day 0 of the study. The starting dose of ADV/IL-12 will be 5 \u00d7 1011 vp. ADV/IL-12 dose level will de-escalate based on Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) occurrence: dose level -1, 3 \u00d7 1011 vp and dose level -2, 1 \u00d7 1011 vp. The starting dose, based on the dose range explored in prior studies, is expected to have activity and dosing changes are only in place in the event that toxicity is demonstrated. Starting on Day 2 of the study, atezolizumab will be administered at 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 2 cycles. Patients with stable disease or better after completion of 2 cycles of atezolizumab will continue to receive atezolizumab Q3W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 12 months."
