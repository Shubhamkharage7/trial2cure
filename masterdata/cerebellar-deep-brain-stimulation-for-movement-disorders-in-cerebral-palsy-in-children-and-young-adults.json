Ten children and young adults with dyskinetic cerebral palsy will be implanted with a Medtronic Percept Primary Cell Neurostimulator. We will pilot videotaped automated movement recognition techniques and formal gait analysis, as well as collect and characterize each subject's physiological and neuroimaging markers that may predict hyperkinetic pathological states and their response to therapeutic DBS."

Because many children suffering with CP are severely affected in many areas of their lives including activities of daily living, communication, mobility and overall health, there is an imperative to evaluate new interventions, especially invasive and resource-intensive ones such as DBS, using outcomes that are more meaningful to patients and their caregivers. Scores for each domain and for the total survey are standardized and range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).",
