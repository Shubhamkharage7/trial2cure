            "briefSummary": "The US opioid overdose epidemic has been accompanied by an increase in human immunodeficiency (HIV) among persons who inject drugs. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an FDA approved medication taken daily orally by individuals who are HIV negative, but who are at increased risk for HIV. In order to obtain PrEP, a prescription is needed. Before being prescribed HIV PrEP, it is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to obtain an HIV test first. Although home HIV self-test kits are recommended by the CDC and are locally available, uptake remains low.\n\nCHORUS+ (Comprehensive HIV, Hepatitis C, and Opioid Use Disorder Response to the Unaddressed Syndemic +) is a theory-based, peer-delivered, mobile phone-supported intervention focused on enhancing uptake and adherence to HIV PrEP (primary outcome), and continuation of MOUD (secondary outcome) among persons who inject opioids. At recruitment, the intervention will include HIV self-testing, rapid initiation of PrEP and MOUD, and 6-month peer recovery coaching (PRC) to support adherence to these medications. This research study seeks to determine the efficacy of a novel intervention to increase the uptake of evidence-based measures to prevent HIV and treat opioid use disorder.\n\nThe efficacy of this multi-site, two-arm randomized control trial of CHORUS+ and usual care \\[passive referral\\]. This study is not testing the efficacy of PrEP or HIV home testing which is already known. In addition the investigators will determine the influence of HIV self-testing on PrEP uptake and adherence. In the CHORUS+/ intervention arm, there will be a baseline in-person session with the participant to encourage uptake of PrEP and MOUD using motivational interviewing (MI)."
