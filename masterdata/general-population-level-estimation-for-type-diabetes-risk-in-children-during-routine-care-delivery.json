Research suggests that screening and identifying children at risk for T1D autoantibodies can prevent serious illness at the time of diagnosis and improve long-term health outcomes.\n\nThe investigators will screen children, ages 0-5.99 or 9-16 years for blood markers related to T1D and celiac disease during routine healthcare delivery at birth, 1, 2 and 5 years, or once between 9 and 16 years of age. Children with confirmed autoantibodies will be offered participation in other monitoring or prevention trials (T1D), or referred to clinical care (celiac)."
