            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial investigates how well modified VR-CAP (bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, prednisone, and cytarabine hydrochloride) and acalabrutinib as first line therapy work in treating transplant-eligible patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Modified VR-CAP is a combination of drugs used as standard first line treatment for mantle cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cytarabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and depletes malignant B cells, by inducing immune responses and direct toxicity. Acalabrutinib blocks a key enzyme which is needed for malignant cell growth in mantle cell lymphoma. Combining modified VR-CAP and acalabrutinib as first line therapy may be more useful against mantle cell lymphoma compared to the usual treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the proportion of complete metabolic responses according to Lugano criteria at the end of study therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of this regimen. II. To determine the proportion of subjects proceeding to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).\n\nIII. To determine the feasibility and results of stem cell mobilization and successful collection.\n\nIV. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (event monitoring phase), assessed up to 2 years after registration.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess minimal residual disease level after 3 and 6 cycles of therapy using the ClonoSEQ (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington \\[WA\\]), and to explore the relationship between radiographic complete response (CR) rate and baseline features.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nCYCLES 1, 3, AND 5: Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Patients also receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15, rituximab (or rituximab and hyaluronidase human) intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1, and prednisone PO on days 1-5.\n\nCYCLES 2, 4, AND 6: Patients receive acalabrutinib PO BID on days 1-21. Patients also receive rituximab (or rituximab and hyaluronidase human) IV on day 1 and cytarabine IV on days 1-2.\n\nTreatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2 years after registration."
