            "briefSummary": "The burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is unequal among various populations within the United States. This inequality is most notable among African Americans, who exhibit the highest CRC mortality of all US populations. This study aims to evaluate a community-based intervention to educate, assess risk, and overcome barriers to screening among African Americans who are 45 years or older with no personal history of CRC, adenomas, or inflammatory bowel disease and have no family history of CRC.\n\nBarriers being assessed include: Need for establishing care with primary care physician, need for financial assistance, need for reminder calls, need for transportation, need for appointment coordination, and need for education about colonoscopy preparation and procedure",
            "detailedDescription": "After reviewing the existing literature this study team believes that the proposed strategy is inherently unique, thus amenable to experimental inquiry.\n\nThe study will provide much needed data to define the extent to which the proposed multi-faceted approach may be effectively deployed to the target population. This includes the acquisition of data to evaluate the educational program, for which improvement in knowledge may be tested objectively using the study design, as well as survey and feasibility data which is pivotal for improving the strategy.\n\nThe 11 steps for completing cancer screening are listed below:\n\n1. Demographic/Socio-economic information\n2. Knowledge assessment and education\n3. Risk assessment questionnaire \"Am I Average Risk?\"\n4. Do I need screening colonoscopy?\n5. Barriers to colorectal cancer screening\n6. Outreach program evaluation\n7. Participants data entered in REDCap database\n8. Communication with primary care provider and navigator\n9. Participant navigation\n10. Evaluation of navigation services\n11. Program monitoring"
