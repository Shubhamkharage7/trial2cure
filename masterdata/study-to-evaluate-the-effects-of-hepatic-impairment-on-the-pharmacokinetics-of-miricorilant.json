            "detailedDescription": "A reduced, adaptive study design will be used to compare the PK of miricorilant between participants with normal hepatic function and participants with hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh (CP) classification. Initially, participants with moderate hepatic impairment will be enrolled. Since indications for the development of miricorilant include participants with NASH, 3 or 4 of these participants will have NASH. Healthy control participants will be selected matched to these participants with moderate hepatic impairment according to gender, age (\u00b1 10 years), and weight (\u00b1 20 %) using a mean matching procedure. Based on the observed effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the miricorilant PK profile following an interim PK analysis, an optional group of participants with mild hepatic impairment may be evaluated. This optional group, matched to the participants with moderate hepatic impairment using the same procedure, will be enrolled to evaluate the effect of mild hepatic impairment on miricorilant PK."
