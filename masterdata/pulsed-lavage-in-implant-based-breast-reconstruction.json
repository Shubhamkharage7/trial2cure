Randomization will occur using a random number generator with even numbers resulting in a pulsed lavage washout and odd numbers resulting in no pulsed lavage washout.\n\nThe patients will be followed in clinic for a maximum of 3 months to evaluate the surgical site. The two cohorts will be compared at the end of the study to determine whether there is any benefit to using pulsed lavage to wash out the mastectomy pocket during breast reconstruction."
