            "briefSummary": "This is a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) which compares the effectiveness of three surgical techniques for alleviating residual limb pain (RLP), neuroma pain and phantom limb pain (PLP). The three surgical treatments are Targeted Muscles Reinnervation (TMR), Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI), and an active control (neuroma excision and muscle burying). Patients will be follow-up for 4 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "Residual limb pain (RLP), neuroma pain, and phantom limb pain (PLP) can develop after the loss of a body part and fall within the umbrella term postamputation pain. However, the underlaying causes to postamputation pain are diverse and must be addressed accordingly. Surgical treatments for RLP have become a popular approach and have shown great potential for successful outcomes. The two surgical interventions, Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) and Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI), are globally used in pain management therapies.\n\nThis is a multi-centre, double-blind, superiority RCT which takes place at 9 hospitals in 7 countries:the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden; the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute in Bologna, Italy; the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, Canada; Worker Hospital in Santiago, Chile; the NHS Lothian, NHS Clyde \\& Greater Glasgow, and NHS Grampian, UK; Dandenong Hospital, Monash Health in Melbourne, Australia; the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, USA; the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA; and within the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, USA. One hundred ten participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three surgical treatments (TMR, RPNI, or control) in an equal allocation ratio (n = 37 per group). Each participant will be followed up short term (1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery) and long term (2 and 4 years post-surgery). After the 12-month follow-up, the study will be unblinded for the evaluator and the participants. If the participants are unsatisfied with the outcome of the treatment, they may request one of the other treatments. In such a case, a medical evaluation and further treatment options will be discussed in consultation with the clinical investigator at the site.\n\nThe study design is chosen to be able to follow RLP, neuroma pain and PLP intensity before and after surgical treatment as well as to investigate how pain develops up to four years post-surgery. The evaluation methods in the study are based on previously used methods in the literature for RLP-, neuroma- and PLP-related pain research. The questionnaires are previously used in clinical settings."

To prepare the donor nerve, the surgeon will identify the nerve with a painful neuroma and resect the neuroma up to healthy fascicles. Next, the surgeon will identify a motor branch to a nearby target muscle and will confirm muscle contraction using a hand-held nerve stimulator. The motor branch to the target muscle will be transected as close as possible to its entry point without tension. In the final step, the previous nerve stump from which the neuroma was resected will be transferred and coapted to the newly severed motor branch that innervates the target muscle and secured by 2-3 non-resorbable monofilament sutures. The surgery time is approximately 2-3 hours and it takes place in the hospital.",

First, the surgeon identifies the nerve with a painful neuroma and resect the neuroma up to healthy fascicles. Then, a longitudinal intraneural dissection will be performed exposing its fascicles. Next, autologous muscle grafts will be harvested from a healthy donor site, and the dissected nerve stumps will be placed parallel to the muscle fibers. The nerve stump will be secured to the muscle graft, thereafter the graft will be wrapped around the nerve stump and anchored in the folded graft, thus creating an RPNI. This will be repeated for each fascicle obtained from splitting the transected nerve. Lastly, the RPNIs will be placed in a protected area. The surgery time is approximately 2-3 hours and it takes place in the hospital.",

Firstly, the surgeon will identify the nerve with a painful neuroma and thereafter resect the neuroma up to healthy fascicles. Next, the surgeon will identify a nearby muscle which is not involved in joint motion and has limited output opportunities for the nerve. The nerve will then be channeled at least 1 cm inside the muscle without applying any tension to it and secured by 1-2 non-resorbable monofilament sutures. The identified nerve with the painful neuroma will not be treated with any additional therapy than the resection (e.g., diathermy, pharmacotherapy, crushing, etc.).
