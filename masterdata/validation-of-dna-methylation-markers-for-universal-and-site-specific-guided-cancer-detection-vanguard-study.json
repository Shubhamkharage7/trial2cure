Validate candidate universal and site-specific MDMs in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded primary tumor and control specimens.\n\nII. Test MDM-based models for detection of the top 16 most lethal human cancers using a non-invasive biological medium, specifically blood.\n\nIII. Assess feasibility for detection of cancers using urine samples to assay MDMs, RNA or protein in cell free or extra-cellular vesicles; patients may be the same or unique individuals from Aim 1 and 2.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo blood, urine, and/or residual tissue sample collection and have their medical records reviewed on study."
