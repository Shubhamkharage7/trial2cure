            "briefSummary": "The overall objective of the proposed randomized controlled (RCT) is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a 16-week theory-based, remotely-delivered, combined exercise (aerobic and resistance) training intervention for improving cognitive and physical function in older adults (50+ years) with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have mild-to-moderate cognitive and walking impairment. Participants (N=50) will be randomly assigned into exercise training (combined aerobic and resistance exercise) condition or active control (flexibility and stretching) condition. The 16-week intervention will be delivered and monitored remotely within a participant's home/community and supported by Zoom-based chats guided by social cognitive theory (SCT) via a behavioral coach. Participants will receive training materials (e.g., prescriptive manual and exercise equipment), one-on-one coaching, action-planning via calendars, self-monitoring via logs, and SCT-based newsletters. It is hypothesized that the home-based exercise intervention will yield beneficial effects on cognition, mobility, physical activity, and vascular function compared with an active control condition (flexibility and stretching intervention), and these improvements will be sustained during a 16-week follow-up period.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is markedly increasing in prevalence amongst older adults. Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. The current study proposes a remotely-delivered exercise training program for improving cognition and mobility among older adults with MS. The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS."
