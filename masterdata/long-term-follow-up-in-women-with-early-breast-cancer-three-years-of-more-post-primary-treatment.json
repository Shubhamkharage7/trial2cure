Cohort A: Women who participated in previous studies namely NCT02167932, NCT02328313, and NCT03761706, will be re-contacted and consent for this study activities. Cohort B: Women with breast cancer, who did not receive chemotherapy, will be consented to be included in the study, and their electronic medical data will be used.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term effects of treatment and a biomarker of aging cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A,p16INK4a) and relation will be assessed."
