The investigators will compare healthcare \"events\" and healthcare expenditures for children and adults during intervals of at least one year when the subjects were participating in the MOVE program versus intervals of at least one year when the same individuals were not participating in the MOVE program based on health insurance records (i.e. Medicaid). Healthcare events are those which required professional medical services (associated with International Classification of Disease (ICD-XX) codes) or prescription medications. Healthcare events and healthcare expenditures will be reviewed from healthcare records obtained by Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurers and data will be compared between intervals."
