Cohort 2: Participant should not have received any prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Cohorts 3and3b: Participant must have progressed on or after osimertinib monotherapy as the most recent line of treatment. Osimertinib must have been administered as either the first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease or in the second-line setting after prior treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as a monotherapy. Cohort 4: Participants need to currently be on an amivantamab IV Q2W regimen (1,050 mg or 1,400 mg depending on weight) for at least 8 weeks, as part of standard of care, an expanded access program, or as a rollover from a long-term extension, without any amivantamab dose reduction. Cohort 7: Participants must have progressed on or after the combination of amivantamab and lazertinib as the most recent line of treatment. The combination of amivantamab and lazertinib must have been administered as the first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease.

Clinically non-significant thrombosis, such as non-obstructive catheter-associated clots, are not exclusionary; b) All cohorts (with regimens potentially including lazertinib): Participant has a significant genetic predisposition to venous thromboembolic events (VTE; such as Factor V Leiden); c) All cohorts (with regimens potentially including lazertinib): Participant has a prior history of VTE and is not on appropriate therapeutic anticoagulation as per NCCN or local guidelines; d) prolonged corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) interval greater than (\\>) 480 milliseconds (msec) or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or electrophysiologic disease (example, placement of implantable cardioverter defibrillator or atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled rate); e) uncontrolled (persistent) hypertension: systolic blood pressure \\>160 millimeter(s) of mercury (mmHg); diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg; f) Congestive heart failure defined as NYHA class III-IV or hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF) (any New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] class) within 6 months of treatment initiation at Cycle 1/day 1 (C1D1); g) pericarditis/clinically significant pericardial effusion; h) myocarditis; i) baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the institution's lower limit of normal at screening, as assessed by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan\n* Participant has symptomatic brain metastases. A participant with asymptomatic or previously treated and stable brain metastases may participate in this study. Participants who have received definitive radiation or surgical treatment for symptomatic or unstable brain metastases and have been clinically stable and asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks before Screening are eligible, provided they have been either off corticosteroid treatment or are receiving low-dose corticosteroid treatment (less than or equal to \\[\\<=\\] 10 milligrams per day \\[mg/day\\] prednisone or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to treatment allocation",
