The purpose of this research is to learn about myotonic dystrophy by examining cerebrospinal fluid and brain activity in participants. The tests will be low risk and are well tolerated. The information that we gather from this study may help us evaluate, prevent, diagnose, treat, and improve our understanding of myotonic dystrophy. Funding Source- FDA OOPD"
