            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate orthopedic patients undergoing either a total hip replacement (THR) or total knee arthroplasty (TKR) using two dietary supplements, PREPARE and RECOVER, and their recovery times post-surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study involves two dietary supplements that have been formulated by Nirvana Water Sciences Corp for Super Inspired LLC. A pre-operative supplement, called PREPARE, has been created with HMB, Vitamin D, Selenium, Zinc, and Vitamin C to provide pre-operative nutrition, promote lean muscle development and boost immunity. A post-operative supplement, called RECOVER, has been created with HMB, collagen, L-citrulline, resveratrol, and 2-HOBA to help maintain lean muscle, support wound healing and reduce oxidative stress.\n\nHMB or \u03b2eta-hydroxy \u03b2eta-methylbutyrate is a nutritional supplement that has been extensively studied for its potential benefits. It is a substance that your body naturally produces when it breaks down the amino acid leucine, which is essential for protein synthesis and muscle repair. There are over 50 human studies, 40 review articles and four meta-analyses showing its effectiveness and safety. These clinical studies provide evidence of the benefits of HMB and supports the claims that HMB boosts muscle performance, slows muscle degradation, and reduces muscle recovery time.\n\nMuscle atrophy (loss of muscle mass) and poor muscle function are demonstrated in patients suffering from osteoarthritis (OA) involving several joints and particularly the hip and the knee joints. Several studies have shown that this atrophy is worsened in the immediate postoperative period, and complete recovery is not established up to 2 years postop. Little is known about muscular recovery after either total hip replacement (THR) or total knee arthroplasty (TKR)."
