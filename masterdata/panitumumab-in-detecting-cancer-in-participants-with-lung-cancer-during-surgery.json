Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a combination of the antibody drug panitumumab and IRDye800CW, an investigational dye that can be seen using a special camera. Panitumumab-IRDye800 may attach to tumor cells and make them more visible during surgery in patients with lung cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the optimal dose and timing of panitumumab IRDye800 infusion for identifying lung cancer compared to surrounding normal tissue in the ex vivo setting as measured by tumor to background ratio.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the safety and tolerability of the panitumumab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in subjects undergoing resection of lung cancer.\n\nII. Determine whether the primary lung tumor or positive lymph nodes can be detected by near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with panitumumab IRDye800 but not by white light imaging.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase II study.\n\nParticipants receive panitumumab- IRDye800 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 0, and then undergo NIR and surgery within 1-5 days.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 30 days."
