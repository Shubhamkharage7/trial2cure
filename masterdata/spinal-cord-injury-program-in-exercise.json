The primary aim is to examine change in physical activity level after the 8-week M2M and SET interventions. We hypothesize that participants in M2M and SET will have significant increase in physical activity compared to an Attention Control (AC) group after the 8-week intervention. The secondary aim is to examine effects of the M2M and SET interventions on health and quality of life outcomes. We hypothesize that participants in M2M and SET will have significant increases in sleep quality and quality of life and decreases in pain and fatigue compared to AC after the 8-week intervention. Exercise enjoyment in M2M and SET participants will also be explored. The tertiary aim is to evaluate the demographic (age, race, sex), clinical (level of injury, type of injury), and psychosocial (social support, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, self-regulation) variables of two participant groups: 1) compliant participants who completed \u2265 50% of the intervention, and 2) noncompliant participants who completed post-testing but \\< 50% of the intervention or who did not complete post-testing."
