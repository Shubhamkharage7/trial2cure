HNC survivors will complete IMAGE-HN (a validated patient-reported outcome measure \\[PROM\\] of HNC-related body image distress \\[BID\\]; primary endpoint), measures of psychological and social well-being and quality of life (QOL), and measures of theory-derived mechanisms of change underlying BRIGHT (mediators).",
            "detailedDescription": "We will perform a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing BRIGHT with AC to test our hypotheses that BRIGHT reduces BID and improves psychological and social well-being and QOL at 2, 3, 6, and 9-months post-randomization by enhancing body image coping skills and decreasing unhelpful automatic thoughts. HNC survivors with clinically significant BID (N=180) from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM), and Henry Ford Health (HFH) will be randomized 1:1 to BRIGHT or AC. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (n=10/site) and in-depth site visits to assess barriers and facilitators of the adoption of BRIGHT and develop an implementation toolkit to enhance the future adoption of BRIGHT into routine clinical care."
