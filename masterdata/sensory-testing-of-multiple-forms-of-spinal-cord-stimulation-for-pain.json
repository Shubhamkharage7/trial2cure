A common form of neurostimulation therapy is spinal cord stimulation (SCS). In this study, researchers want to learn more about how SCS affects pain processing and relieves pain. The researchers will examine multiple forms of SCS in chronic pain patients who are receiving SCS from their own doctors as part of their standard of care. During the study, participants will be asked to complete a variety of evaluations at certain time points."
