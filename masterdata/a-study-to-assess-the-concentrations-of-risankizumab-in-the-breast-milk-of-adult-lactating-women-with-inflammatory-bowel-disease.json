This study will asses the concentrations of risankizumab in the breast milk of lactating women with IBD\n\nRisankizumab is an approved drug for adults with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's Disease. This is an open-label milk-only study lactation study to evaluate the presence of risankizumab in the milk of lactating women. Approximately 10 adult lactating women with IBD will be enrolled from approximately 3 sites in Israel and or the United States.\n\nParticipants will receive risakizumab maintenance therapy every 8 weeks postpartum prior to start of participation in this study. The study duration is approximately 7 months.\n\nParticipants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The participants will also be completing questionnaires and will have medical assessments, checking for side effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will only include lactating women who are receiving treatment with risankizumab for IBD in accordance with their treating physician, although this study is non-interventional regarding treatment with risankizumab, it is considered interventional due to the collection of breast milk from the lactating mothers."
