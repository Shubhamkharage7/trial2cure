If the primary tumor or other locoregional disease has not been definitively treated and is not amendable to SBRT, it must be treated with conventionally fractionated or hypofractionated radiotherapy using a regimen that delivers a minimum BED of 48 Gy10. If the clinical scenario deem that other forms of local therapy may be more suitable for the primary and locoregional disease, such as surgical resection and interventional radiology-guided ablation, patients would be able to undergo other forms of local therapy with discussion with the PI.\n* If primary disease was previously treated with local therapy in the form of surgery or radiation, any new local/regional disease recurrence should be technically treatable with SBRT or hypofractionated radiation.
