            "briefSummary": "This study will test whether enfortumab vedotin combined with pembrolizumab is an effective treatment for people with bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma) involving the lymph nodes who are going to have surgery to remove their cancer (cystectomy). The researchers will look at whether treatment with enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab before surgery can get rid of cancer within the lymph nodes. They will also try to find out if this combination of drugs is effective at shrinking participants' cancer before their surgery.\n\nThe researchers think that a combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab may help people with this disease because both drugs are designed to help the immune system attack and kill cancer cells. The researchers think the drugs may be more effective if given in combination rather than on their own."
