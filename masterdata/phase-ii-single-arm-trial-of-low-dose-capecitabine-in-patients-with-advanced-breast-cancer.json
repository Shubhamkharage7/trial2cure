Participants will include older/frail patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n\nAll patients will be treated with capecitabine 1000 mg daily. There will be a total of 40 participants with measurable disease on this trial.\n\nThe study will encompass participants with locally advanced unresectable/metastatic breast cancer with measurable disease, who progressed on at least 1 prior therapy in the metastatic setting. Breast cancer subtypes include HR+ HER2 negative, or TNBC, age \u2265 60 years old, or frail patients at a younger age. ECOG PS 0- 2.\n\nThe study will discontinue if progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity is noted."
