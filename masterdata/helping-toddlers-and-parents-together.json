            "briefSummary": "Using stakeholder feedback (i.e., behavioral health providers \\& caregivers), the goal of this study is to develop a behavioral parenting program that focuses on both parent mental health and parenting for parents of toddlers (12-35 months old). Using a deployment focused intervention model, this study will : (1) develop an early parenting intervention for parents of at-risk toddlers which integrates a focus on parent mental health with evidence-based behavioral parenting strategies, and (2) examine context-specific factors related to the intervention, including feasibility and acceptability to design a more practice-ready intervention.",
            "detailedDescription": "Very early identification of children and families at risk of developing psychopathology can lead to early prevention/intervention to address challenging behaviors before they become more severe, likely reducing the length and cost of interventions. Using the information provided by the stakeholder group, the current study will implement in an open trial the early parenting intervention for ADHD parents of at-risk toddlers (n = 10 families) via telehealth by primary care co-located psychologists. Investigators will examine implementation factors including fidelity, feasibility (utility, adherence) and acceptability (facilitators, barriers) of the early parenting intervention. Quantitative data (adherence checklists, symptom measures, observational parenting measures) will be used to assess the extent to which primary care providers and office staff adhere to the intervention manual, as well as changes in toddler and parent behavior resulting from the intervention. Qualitative data (interviews/ focus groups) with stakeholders (behavioral health providers and caregivers of toddlers) will inform a refined intervention model and assess perceptions of utility, fit, and satisfaction of the intervention components. This mixed-methods approach will offer the most comprehensive examination of an early parenting intervention model for parents of at-risk toddlers in a pediatric primary care setting."
