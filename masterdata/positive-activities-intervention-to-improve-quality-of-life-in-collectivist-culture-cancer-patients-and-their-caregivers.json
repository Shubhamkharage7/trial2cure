            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial studies the feasibility of two positive activities in improving quality of life in collectivist culture cancer patients and their caregivers. Cancer patients of collectivist cultures (e.g., Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans) have been found to experience lower quality of life and more distress and depression when compared to those of individualist cultures, such as European Americans. Following a cancer diagnosis, collectivist patients may experience a change in their relationships with other family members and their roles within the family. The cancer diagnosis may lead to changes in roles and responsibilities, such as when a male breadwinner is no longer able to work due to hospital treatments. The two positive activities are designed to increase a sense of competence, autonomy, and connectedness, including contributing to household responsibilities (an act of kindness) and writing a letter of gratitude. Performing certain simple activities may improve quality of life in cancer patients and their caregivers.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a study of two positive activities intended to improve the psychological and interpersonal well-being of cancer patients from collectivist cultures.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To preliminarily assess changes in psychological, interpersonal, and physical well-being of the intervention patients and caregivers compared to control patients and caregivers.\n\nII. To preliminarily assess changes in psychological, interpersonal, and physical well-being of patients and caregivers who are members of collectivist cultures (African American, Asian American, or Latino/Hispanic) compared to patients and caregivers who are members of individualist (European American) cultures.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To explore mechanisms through which the interventions may improve psychological and interpersonal well-being.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 conditions.\n\nCONDITION I (CONTRIBUTION): Patients do 1 nice thing (can be as large or as small as they wish) 2 times per week (BIW) for 4 weeks for their caregivers while at home.\n\nCONDITION II (GRATITUDE): Patients write a letter or note of gratitude BIW for 4 weeks to their caregivers who have helped with their treatment or recovery.\n\nCONDITION III (CONTROL): Participants keep track of their daily activities.\n\nAfter completion of study, participants are followed up for 28 days."
