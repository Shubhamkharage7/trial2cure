            "briefSummary": "The current study proposes to develop, refine, and conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative prevention program that is the first to (a) simultaneously target heavy episodic drinking (HED), sexually aggressive behavior (SAB), and risky sexual behavior (RSB) among college men; (b) integrate personalized feedback and cognitive training strategies; and (c) target the five major modifiable risk factors for SAB: HED, impersonal sex, misperceptions of sexual interest, rape-supportive attitudes, and peer influence. The program will be computer-delivered as this approach is well received by college students.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will include three phases (pilot feasibility n=10; pilot acceptability/efficacy n=40; RCT n=140), with 190 men at risk for HED, RSB, and SAB. Participants in the RCT will be randomly assigned to either the computer-based program or services as usual at 2 large public universities in the midwest and southwest U.S. The three study phases will address the following aims:\n\nAIM ONE: Examine the feasibility of the computer administered personalized feedback and cognitive training approach (Phase I; n=10), and the acceptability and efficacy of individual intervention components based on skills assessments and interviews at 1-month follow-up (Phase II; n=40). Data from Phases I and II will be used to modify and streamline the intervention prior to the RCT (Phase III).\n\nAIM TWO: In an RCT (n=140), evaluate whether the prevention program impacts cognitive training and personalized feedback targets at 1-month follow-up, relative to services as usual (SAU). Cognitive training targets include (a) enhanced focus on women's affect; (b) reduced focus on women's non-affective cues; and (c) correction of over-perceptions of women's sexual interest. Personalized feedback targets include (a) increased readiness to change; (b) increased perceptions of risk; and (c) reduced misperceptions of peer attitudes and behaviors.\n\nAIM THREE: Evaluate whether the prevention program shows short-term effects on attitudinal (e.g., rape supportive and sociosexual attitudes) and behavioral outcomes (SAB, HED, and RSB) at 1-month follow-up."

We will introduce the role of men's sexual-perception skills in satisfying social and sexual interactions with women, as well as problematic sexual behavior including RSB and SAB. Next, we will instruct participants that affective information is the best-available nonverbal information about how a woman is feeling about a specific man. This instruction will focus on distinguishing four primary dating relevant cues: sexual-interest, friendliness, sadness, and rejection. More detailed focus on each cue will emphasize the increased difficulty of reading these cues with a new partner and under the influence of alcohol and sexual arousal, as well as the importance of checking verbally on assumptions about a woman's current sexual interest.",
