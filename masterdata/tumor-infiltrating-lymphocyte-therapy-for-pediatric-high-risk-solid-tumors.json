If this is the case, the investigator may choose to enroll the patient prior to a tissue diagnosis. Their suspicion of a qualifying diagnosis should be documented. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient may continue on study. If the diagnosis is not confirmed, the patient will be considered a screening failure and removed from study.\n* Relapsed/refractory/recurrent patients: patients must have a histologic diagnosis of pMST (may include diagnoses outside those identified in Part 1) that has relapsed after achieving remission or progressed after completion of all planned initial therapy.\n* Patients must have an open surgical biopsy or resection planned (core needle/final needle biopsies are not allowed) for standard of care purposes, at some point in their initial or relapsed therapy for pMST.\n\nNote: The surgery for tissue procurement may occur at any time during initial therapy including up-front surgeries or after neoadjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation.\n\n\u2022 All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent or assent document.\n\nPart Two: Phase I Clinical Trial\n\n* \u22651-year-old at enrollment.

Adjuvant therapy for poor prognosis tumors: patients qualifying for TIL collection as per Part 1, deemed by the treating investigator to have \\<30% chance at long-term cure who has reached the end of their primary therapy with a disease status of Stable Disease or better and who have achieved appropriate washout period. Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 is NOT required for these patients.\n* Organ function requirements:\n\n  1. Adequate hematologic function, defined as: Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm3, greater than 7 days from short-acting myeloid growth factors and at least 14 days from long-acting myeloid growth factors, Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3 without transfusion within 7 days and without platelet growth factors for at least 14 days, and Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dL without transfusion within 14 days.\n  2.

The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair.\n  4. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair.\n  5. Cellular Therapy: \u2265 42 days must have elapsed from last dose of any type of cellular therapy (e.g. modified T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, etc.)\n  6. Interleukins, Interferons, and Cytokines (other than Hematopoietic Growth Factors): \u2265 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose of interleukins, interferon or cytokines (other than Hematopoietic Growth Factors).\n  7.

Patients with hepatitis C antibody must have a negative (undetectable) viral load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n* Patients who are pregnant or nursing.\n* Sexually active patients of reproductive potential are eligible if they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method from the time of informed consent through the duration and for 1 month following completion of protocol treatment. The definition of an effective contraceptive method will be at the discretion of the institutional investigator.\n* Patients needing chronic immunosuppressive systemic steroids are excluded. Any supraphysiologic doses of steroids should be discontinued by the time of enrollment.\n* Patients with autoimmune diseases that require immunosuppressive medications.\n* Patients with central nervous system metastases, currently active or in the past.\n* Patients with history of prior solid organ transplant.\n* Inability to comprehend and give informed consent.\n* Patients receiving concomitant anti-cancer therapies or investigational therapies.",
