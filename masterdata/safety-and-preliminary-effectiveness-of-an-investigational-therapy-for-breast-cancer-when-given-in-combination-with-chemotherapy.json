This includes that they are able to understand and follow study-related instructions.\n* Have confirmed locally recurrent inoperable or mTNBC as defined by the most recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) / College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Note, participants initially diagnosed with hormone receptor positive and/or HER2-positive breast cancer must have histological confirmation of TNBC in a tumor biopsy obtained from a local recurrence or distant metastasis site.\n\n  * Systemic treatment na\u00efve locally advanced/metastatic participants are eligible if:\n\n    * They have received no prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced unresectable/metastatic setting including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents.\n    * They have completed treatment for Stage I-III breast cancer, if indicated, and \u22656 months has elapsed between the completion of treatment with curative intent (e.g., date of primary breast tumor surgery or date of last adjuvant chemotherapy administration, whichever occurred last) and first documented local or distant disease recurrence.\n  * Participants who received one prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting are eligible if they have received systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy in the first-line setting. If immunotherapy was given - a minimum of two doses of a programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor must have been administered in the first-line locally advanced unresectable/metastatic setting. Radiographic progression must have been documented. Radiographic progression is defined as unequivocal progression of existing tumor lesions or developing new tumor lesions as assessed by the investigator.\n* Have provided a tissue sample, archival or fresh, during the screening period (bone biopsies, fine needle aspiration biopsies, and samples from pleural or peritoneal fluid are not acceptable; participants with only one target lesion are not eligible to provide a biopsy). The participants most recent formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor sample should be provided (up to a maximum of 24 months prior to the start of the study; unstained sections, 3-5 \u00b5m or tissue block). If an archival tumor sample is not available, the participant must undergo a fresh biopsy, if medically feasible to be eligible for the study.\n* Have at least one measurable lesion as the targeted lesion based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions treated after prior local treatment (radiotherapy, ablation, interventional procedures) are generally not considered as target lesions. If the lesion with prior local treatment is the only targeted lesion, evidence-based radiology must be provided to demonstrate disease progression (the single bone metastasis or the single central nervous system metastasis should not be considered as a measurable lesion).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Have a minimum life expectancy of \\>3 months.\n* Have adequate organ function, as defined below:\n\n  * Hematology:\n\n    * Absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5 \u00d7 10\\^9/L.

Note, Gilbert's syndrome must be documented appropriately as past medical history.\n    * Participants without liver metastasis alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase \u22642 \u00d7 ULN.\n    * Participants with liver metastasis alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase \u22645 \u00d7 ULN.\n    * Albumin \u22653.0 g/dL.\n  * Renal function: Serum creatinine \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min. Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n  * Qualitative urine protein \u22641+. If qualitative urine protein \u22652+, a 24-hour urine protein quantitative test is required. If the 24-hour urine protein result is \\<1 g, the participant can be enrolled.\n  * Coagulation function: International normalized ratio or prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN unless the participant is receiving anticoagulation therapy as long as prothrombin or activated partial thromboplastin is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulant.\n* Are women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin test at screening and before each IMP dose. Women born female that are postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause) or permanently sterilized (verified by medical records) will not be considered WOCBP and therefore will not be required to undergo pregnancy testing.\n* Are WOCBP who agree to practice a highly effective form of contraception and to require their male partners to use condoms, starting at Screening and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last study treatment.\n* Are men who are sexually active with a partner born female and have not had a vasectomy who agree to use condoms and to practice a highly effective form of contraception during the study, starting at Screening and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last dose of IMP.\n* Are WOCBP who agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during study, starting at Screening and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last dose of IMP.\n* Are men who are willing to refrain from sperm donation, starting at Screening and continuously until 6 months after receiving the last dose of IMP.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Are pregnant or breastfeeding or are planning pregnancy or planning to father children during the study or within 60 days or five half-lives if known (whichever is longer) after the last dose of IMP.\n* Have a medical, psychological, or social condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise their wellbeing if they participate in the study, or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments or procedures, or that could impact adherence to protocol described requirements.\n* Have histories of alcoholic abuse, psychotropic drug abuse, or illicit drug addiction.\n* Have received any of the following therapies or drugs prior to the initiation of study:\n\n  * Participants who received prior treatment with a PD(L)-1/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor bispecific antibody.\n  * Have received a systemic anticancer regimen within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment or have received palliative radiotherapy within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment, or have received any other chemotherapy, curative/palliative radiotherapy, biologic therapy (including tumor vaccines, cytokines, or growth factors for tumor control) or any experimental antitumor drugs within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment.\n  * Have received other systemic immunostimulatory agents or immunosuppressive therapies (such as interferon-alpha \\[IFN-\u03b1\\], interleukin-2 \\[IL-2\\], or methotrexate) within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment or are within five half-lives of the treatment drug (whichever is longer).
