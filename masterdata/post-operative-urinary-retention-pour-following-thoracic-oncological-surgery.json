            "briefSummary": "This is a feasibility study looking at whether the use of Tamsulosin could lower the high incidence of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) in older men who undergo an oncological thoracic surgical procedure for suspected or confirmed cancer. In addition, the study will try to identify the time of resumption of presurgical urinary function post Tamsulosin administration.",
            "detailedDescription": "Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) is a significant problem in post-operative patients. The incidence varies, but can reach up to 70%, which most commonly affects older men with enlarged prostates. Even after adjusting for the modifiable risk factors, such as decreased intraoperative foley use and post-operative narcotic use, the incidence remains high. This causes an increase in urinary tract infections, patient discomfort, longer hospital stays, and occasionally further urologic complications. Studies have shown that the use of tamsulosin, an alpha1-adrenergic receptor blocker, may decrease the incidence of POUR by improving urinary flow via relaxation of the smooth muscle tissue. Therefore, the goal of our study is to investigate whether Tamsulosin (Flomax) can be used to lower incidence of POUR in older men undergoing an oncological thoracic surgical procedure.\n\nThis is a pilot/feasibility/ early efficacy study to determine if treating men \\> 55 years of age with Tamsulosin prior to a thoracic oncological surgery will prevent postoperative urinary retention (POUR).\n\nSubjects will be provided with a prescription for Tamsulosin (generic) to be taken 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. For research purposes, post-surgical spontaneous voids will be measured, and any residual urine in the bladder will be assessed and measured using a BladderScanner. This data will be used to determine postoperative urinary retention (POUR). Additionally, standard of care bladder management will be used if the subject did not spontaneously void or had excess urine residual. The algorithm in the table below will guide bladder management decisions."
