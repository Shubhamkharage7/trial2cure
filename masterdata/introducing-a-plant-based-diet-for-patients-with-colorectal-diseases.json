            "briefSummary": "Dietary patterns are a potentially modifiable risk factor for colon cancer recurrence, flares in inflammatory bowel diseases, and for chronic diseases. Nutritional counseling is rarely brought up during medical appointment. As a result, patients are often left confused regarding which specific dietary recommendation to follow after surgical treatment. A plant-based diet is naturally high in fiber and is beneficial to long-term health, especially for patients with colorectal diseases.\n\nThe aims of this study are to:\n\n1. Determine whether an educational intervention is effective in increasing intake of plants\n2. Identify barriers and facilitators to adoption of a plant-based diet among patients with colorectal diseases\n3. Identify secondary health gains related to adoption of a plant-based diet.",
            "detailedDescription": "Standard of care: patients with colorectal diseases are sometimes advised to eat healthfully before and after to surgery. They are also encouraged to increase fiber intake and to take fiber supplements, but not particularly encouraged to eat more plants.\n\nResearch Activities:\n\n1. Screening: eligible patients will be identified through screening the clinic schedules. Participants that might be eligible will be asked if they are interested in being contacted by the research team.\n2. Enrollment: in person or remotely, if the patient demonstrates interest in participating, the research team will explain details about the study. If the patient agrees, they will be asked to provide consent\n3. Intervention: at baseline, data will be collected regarding clinical information of the patients (age, body mass index, comorbidities, medications or supplements, physical activity level), and baseline dietary pattern, which will be evaluated through a validated shortened Food Frequency Questionnaire. Patients will be assessed regarding their stage of change according to the transtheoretical model. A Food Choice Questionnaire will be administered to understand what drives their food choices. A Quality of Life questionnaire for patients recovering from surgery will also be administered.\n\n   The intervention proposed is a \"6-week challenge\", in which participants will be encouraged to make at least one change towards a plant-based diet per week. They will receive weekly emails with information about plant-based diets and a goal/task for each week.\n\n   There will be a 'core curriculum' that will be sent to all participants, as well as additional information according to the participant's stage of change and food choice preferences.\n\n   All information will be available on a website that was created for this study (http://eat2heal.su.domains/). The website features curated information about plant-based diets, and is tailored to patients who had recent colorectal operations and may have a colostomy or an ileostomy. The goal is to recruit 60 patients with colorectal diseases\n4. Closeout: At the end of the intervention period, the quality of life and food frequency questionnaires will be re-administered.\n\nSemi-structured interviews will be conducted at the end of the intervention period to identify areas for improvement, barriers and facilitators to adopt a plant-based diet, and other health attitudes that may have changed as a result of the intervention."
