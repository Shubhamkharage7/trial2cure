            "briefSummary": "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) lesions are initiated by endothelial cells infected with KS herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Lesion progression is driven by abnormal angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, and uncontrolled cell proliferation. KS remains one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in many African countries where economic constraints prevent successful treatment in most patients. Treatment outcomes in developed countries are also often unsatisfactory in HIV positive patients despite good virological and immunological responses to antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, identification of new oral, safe treatment options for treatment of KS remains a research priority. Given the known anti-angiogenic properties and based on the treatment response with other benign vascular lesions such as infantile hemangioma, propranolol is a good candidate for the treatment of KS. The hypothesis of this study is that treating patients with Kaposi sarcoma with propranolol will result in an overall response rate (complete response rate plus partial response rate) of at least 45%, and that propranolol will be safe and well tolerated in this patient population."
