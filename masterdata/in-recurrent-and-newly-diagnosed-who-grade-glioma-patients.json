Patients stable on concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval may be allowed to participate in the study provided that their mean resting corrected QT interval (QTcF) is \\< 470 msec at baseline and after discussion with the Medical Monitor.\n8. History of epileptic disorder or any seizure history unrelated to tumor.\n9. History or presence of myopathy or raised creatine kinase (CK) \\>5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) on 2 occasions at screening.\n10. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.\n11. Participant has serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment \\[e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \\<30ml/min\\], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea).\n12.

Prior treatment with pneumotoxic drugs, e.g. busulfan, bleomycin, within the past year. If prior therapy in lifetime, then excluded if history of pulmonary toxicities from administration. Patients who have received treatment with nitrosoureas (e.g., BCNU, CCNU) in the year before study entry without experiencing lung toxicity are allowed on study.\n15. Treatment with another investigational drug or other intervention within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer.\n16. With the exception of alopecia, any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v5.0) Grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment and patients with chronic Grade 2 unresolved toxicities may be eligible following discussion with the Medical Monitor.",
