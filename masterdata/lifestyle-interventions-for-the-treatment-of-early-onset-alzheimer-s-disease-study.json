It is hypothesized that participants in the experimental training condition will perform better on outcomes related to cognition, functioning, and mood at follow-up compared to participants assigned to the active control condition.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study aims to generate preliminary data regarding the efficacy of a combined cognitive-training and Tai Chi- Qi Gong exercise lifestyle intervention in participants diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD). Participants will complete a series of cognitive, functional, and mood assessments at a remotely-assessed baseline visit, and then be randomized into one of two conditions: (1) Computerized Cognitive Training + Tai Chi Exercise or (2) Active Control. Outcome measures will be repeated immediately Post-Treatment and at 6-months post-treatment Follow-Up. Specific Aim 1 will examine the feasibility of this lifestyle intervention and outcome assessments when applied to participants with EOAD. Specific Aim 2 will investigate if this lifestyle intervention improves short- and long-term cognition, functioning, and mood. Specific Aim 3 will be exploratory to assess whether individual differences in training or clinical/ demographic characteristics moderate the degree of benefit from this intervention; owing to sample size limitations in this feasibility study, focus of this latter aim will be on determining effect sizes and sample-size magnitude needed for future work."
