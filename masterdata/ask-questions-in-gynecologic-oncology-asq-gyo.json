Also to determine the acceptability of the ASQ-GYO QPL with new gynecologic oncology patients.",

If eligible, participants will then be randomized to usual care or the intervention (ASk Questions in GYnecologic Oncology question prompt list (ASQ-GYO QPL)\n* If randomized to receive the ASQ-QYO QPL, they will be emailed this document and given a paper copy of the ASQ-GYO QPL in the waiting room prior to their visit to ensure they have received the intervention.\n* Directly after the participant's visit, all participants will be asked to complete the post-visit survey on a tablet in the clinic waiting room, or via a secure link in an email within 1 week of the appointment.\n* After completion of the post-visit survey and within one month of their visit, participants who were not randomized to receive the ASQ-GYO QPL will be sent the ASQ-GYO QPL via email so that they may also have access to this resource."
