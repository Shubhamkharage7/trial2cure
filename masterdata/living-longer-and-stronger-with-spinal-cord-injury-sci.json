LLS group participants will participate in 2-hour weekly sessions co-facilitated by a study investigator and one of the study's senior advisors. Participants will be encouraged to set a health-oriented goal and complete weekly action plans. They will be provided with materials each week with health-related information and resources. Participants will also be asked to complete a short survey each week to rate the session. After completing the 8 sessions, a link to the post-test survey and some questions to evaluate the LLS program will be sent to the participants. Finally there will be follow up survey to be completed at 4 months post intervention.",
