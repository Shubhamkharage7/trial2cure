            "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to test the early effects and implementation of an enhanced community health worker (CHW) model (T1D-CATCH) that encourages and supports diabetes technology use in young adults from underrepresented minority groups (YA-URMs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The investigators will conduct a 9-month randomized controlled trial in which YA-URMs will be randomized to T1D-CATCH or usual care. The investigators will recruit from adult and pediatric endocrinology and primary care practices in a large safety-net health system in the Bronx, New York. Our specific aims are to 1) evaluate T1D-CATCH effects on technology initiation and continued use over 6 months and 2) evaluate T1D-CATCH implementation using Proctor's Taxonomy of Implementation Outcomes: feasibility, adoption, fidelity, and cost.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will involve a 9-month randomized control trial of usual care versus T1D-CATCH, an intervention that enhances core community health worker (CHW) service roles to support increased use of T1D technology in young adults (underrepresented minorities)(YA_URM's). Participants will be recruited from primary and specialty care practices at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, NY, which is a large safety-net hospital system in one of the poorest counties in the U.S. Two young adult-aged CHWs from the Montefiore CHW program will be trained extensively per our Supporting Emerging Adults with Diabetes (SEAD) program manuals. For YA-URMs, CHWs will conduct hands-on diabetes technology education, goal-setting, peer support, and social service linkage. CHWs will also help shift insurance approval tasks away from busy providers and better align patient-provider priorities through close communication between the YA-URM and provider. Group sessions will be optional and will follow the YA-centric education curriculum developed in Dr. Agarwal's Supporting Emerging Adults with Diabetes (SEAD) program."

CHWs engender trust with patients by having direct community and lived experience, offering specific support and empathy that may be difficult for other diabetes care professionals to provide. In addition, CHWs have firsthand understanding of cultural barriers to traditional western healthcare and can promote patient-centered culturally-relevant care. They enhance team-based care by helping providers with extra outreach, social needs management, time-consuming tasks, and aligning patient-provider priorities.\n\nCHWs in this project will provide social needs assessment and management, introduction to diabetes technologies, and support for onboarding to technology.",
