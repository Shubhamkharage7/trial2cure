            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, single-arm, single-stage phase 2 study to evaluate the activity of Belumosudil in subjects with new onset of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) (Cohort A) and for subjects with incipient BOS (Cohort B) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Belumosudil is a novel immunosuppressive agent that has both immunosuppressive activity as well as antifibrotic (slowing down the rate of fibrosis or scarring in the lungs) properties.\n\nParticipants will be placed into one of two treatment groups: Group A Belumosudil + standard of care medications for BOS versus Group B Belumosudil only.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved belumosudil for the initial or preventative therapy of BOS, but it has been approved for the treatment of Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD).\n\nThe other study drugs, Fluticasone, Azithromycin, Montelukast, and Prednisone are FDA approved as standard of care drugs for BOS.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility, treatment visits, blood tests, pulmonary function tests, bronchoscopy wit bronchoalveolar lavage, and Computed Tomography (CT) Scans.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for 11 months (48 weeks) and will be followed for an additional 12 months after completion of study treatment.\n\nIt is expected that about 45 people (30 in Group A and 15 in Group B) will take part in this research study.\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is supporting this research study by providing funding.\n\nSanofi is supporting this research study by providing study drug, Belumosudil."

An active uncontrolled infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs, or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persistent fever without signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as an active uncontrolled infection.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. Interactions between belumosudil and anti-retroviral agents have not been established.\n* Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus infection that requires treatment or at risk for HBV reactivation. At risk for HBV reactivation is defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positive or anti-hepatitis B core antibody positive. Subjects with previous positive serology results must have negative polymerase chain reaction results. Subjects whose immune status is unknown or uncertain must have results confirming immune status before enrollment.",
