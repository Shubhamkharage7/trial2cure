            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To examine the effects of stimulation duration (stimulation days) and intensity (pulses per day) on outcomes among smokers (sample size \\[n\\]=258) motivated to quit.\n\nII. To identify the most promising dosing strategy by balancing effect sizes and undesirable effects.\n\nIII. To examine the effects of 16 20Hz rTMS sessions combined with intensive cognitive behavioral treatment and nicotine replacement on smoking cessation, developmental disability (DD rates), cognitive behavioral skill acquisition, and nicotine patch adherence among lung cancer (LC) patients (n=30). (Study 1 and Study 2) IV. To examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of 20Hz rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for concurrent smoking abstinence and reductions in alcohol use among smokers who are heavy drinkers (n=20). (Study 1 and Study 2)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo rTMS once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) over 16 minutes for 8, 12, or 16 days.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo sham rTMS QD or BID over 16 minutes for 8, 12, or 16 days."
