Other aims are to check the growth and development of babies breastfed by their mothers who took prucalopride and to check if the babies had any side effects.\n\nDuring the study, participants will provide one set of milk samples over 24 hours using an electric breast pump. Breast milk samples will be collected at home and will be shipped to the laboratory.\n\nAlso, participants will be asked questions during telephone interviews every 2 months in the first year of their baby's life. They will also be asked to complete growth and development questionnaires about their baby."
