            "briefSummary": "Bleedings in the upper digestive tract are common. Usually, laboratory and clinical parameters are considered to establish a suspicion for a bleeding in the digestive tract and to estimate urgency of the situation. If these parameters suggest the presence of a bleeding in the digestive tract, endoscopies are often performed to further investigate a patient's status. The above-mentioned laboratory and clinical parameters are sometimes not specific enough to reliably identify a bleeding in the upper digestive tract. The HemoPill acute is capsule device, that has a built in sensor that detects blood in the upper digestive tract. This information is valuable for the medical personnel and complements the information that is obtained from other laboratory or clinical tests",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study was to access safety and accuracy of Hemopill and its receiver. Patients scheduled for endoscopy on the basis of suspected UGIB are generally eligible for inclusion into the trial. After patient screening, information and obtaining informed consent, a patient is enrolled into the trial. Shortly before the scheduled endoscopy is performed, the patient ingests a HemoPill acute. Endoscopy is performed as scheduled. Blood within the GI lumen is identified if present and pictures are taken. Pathologies, if found, are treated as per clinical standard. The HemoPill acute measurement regarding presence or absence of blood in the GI lumen is compared to observations made during endoscopy."
