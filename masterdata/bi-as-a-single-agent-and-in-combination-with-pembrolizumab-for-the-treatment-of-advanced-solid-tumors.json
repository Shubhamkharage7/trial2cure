            "briefSummary": "The goal of this first in human clinical trial is to test BI-1910 administered as single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed after standard therapy.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* how safe and tolerable is BI-1910\n* what is maximum tolerated or administrated dose\n* to determine recommended dose for further clinical trials\n\nParticipants will receive infusions of BI-1910 alone or combination with pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.",

Phase 2a expansion will be conducted in indication specific cohorts of subjects. The aim of the Phase 2a is to urther assess the safety and tolerability of BI-1910 as a single agent (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B), characterize its PK and pharmacodynamics, and assess preliminary antitumor activity by ORR, DoR, and progression-free survival (PFS), as measured by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST."
