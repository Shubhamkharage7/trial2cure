Collagen deposition is a pivotal event in several human conditions including radiation induced lung injury and in response to radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer. The investigator's studies in murine models of lung injury including radiation induced lung injury showed that \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 binds collagen with high affinity and has excellent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles with high target uptake and low retention in background tissues and organs. \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 was shown in a mouse model to be effective for detecting lung fibrosis. \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 showed high specificity for pulmonary fibrosis and high target:background ratios in diseased animals. In addition, \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 could be used to monitor response to treatment. Ex vivo analysis of lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) supported the animal findings.\n\nThe investigators have conducted preliminary studies in humans with IPF and demonstrated a significant increase in \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 signal in subjects with IPF vs healthy controls.\n\nThe investigators thus aim to evaluate \\[68Ga\\]CBP8 in human subjects with radiation induced lung injury and in patients undergoing radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer:\n\nTo establish the ability of \\[68Ga\\]CBP8-PET to detect radiation-induced fibrosis in lung or pancreatic cancer patients through the course of disease development with repeated measures, and correlate signal with standard measures of radiation induced tissue injury such as HRCT or MRI."
