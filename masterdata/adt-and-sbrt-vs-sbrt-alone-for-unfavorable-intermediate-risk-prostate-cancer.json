The patient population will include those with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-defined unfavorable intermediate risk disease. All patients will be followed every 6 months for up to 5 years from the first patient randomized and will undergo a routine 24-30 months post-SBRT prostate biopsy to assess for local tumor control."
