            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\n- Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare type of lung disease that occurs almost exclusively in women. In LAM, muscle tissue grows in the lungs and starts to block the flow of air. It is a progressive disease, and in severe cases may require a lung transplant. One possible treatment to improve breathing in people with LAM is inhaled albuterol. Albuterol can be given in a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or with a nebulizer. Researchers want to compare these methods to see which method best improves lung function in women with LAM.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To see whether a nebulizer or MDI can better improve lung function in women with LAM.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Women at least 18 years of age who have impaired lung function because of LAM.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. No lab tests will be needed for this study.\n* Participants will have a 3-day overnight stay at the National Institutes of Health. Those who are using long-acting inhalers will have to stop taking these drugs 1 week before the study.\n* Participants will receive either the nebulizer or two or four puffs of the inhaler. Four puffs of albuterol is a higher dose than is normally prescribed, and is being tested on this study.\n* Participants will have each treatment around the same time of day on each of the 3 days. Before and after taking the albuterol, participants will have lung function tests.",
            "detailedDescription": "We have reported that approximately one third of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) who have airflow obstruction respond to bronchodilators such as albuterol, a Beta2-adenergic receptor agonist, with an increase in forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) of 12% and 200 ml above baseline values. Others however, have questioned these findings, reporting instead, a low rate of response of only six percent. Contrasting with our study, in this study albuterol was administered with a metered dose inhaler whereas in ours it was given by nebulizer. We propose to measure changes in lung function after administration of albuterol, respectively by metered inhaler and nebulizer, for 3 consecutive days in 100 LAM subjects. Our hypothesis is that albuterol administered by nebulization will produce a greater increase in FEV1 than two puffs of inhaled albuterol. If this hypothesis is confirmed, then we may recommend that patients with LAM and airflow obstruction use as a method of drug administration a nebulizer, rather than a metered dose inhaler."
