            "detailedDescription": "Design a model to predict hypoglycemic episodes in real time, rather than retrospectively identifying high risk patients who experienced a hypoglycemic event at some point during their hospitalization, as has been done prior. Potential predictors of hypoglycemia identified in prior work and additional predictors identified by the clinical team to develop a discrete-time multinomial logistic regression model to predict hypoglycemic events in real time. The risk score then will be piloted in the context of our institution's EndoTool Subcutaneous implementation determine the feasibility and acceptability of viewing the risk score in the Electronic Health Record"
