            "briefSummary": "This research study will determine whether orally administered ADX-629 is safe and has biochemical efficacy in patients with Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS), a rare inherited disorder of fatty aldehyde metabolism The disease is caused by bi-allelic mutations in ALDH3A2, which results in deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and leads to the build-up of harmful long-chain (C16-C20) aldehydes and alcohols. Accumulation of these lipids and their metabolic products in skin, brain and eyes is responsible for the symptoms, which persist lifelong. ADX-629 is an aldehyde trapping agent that is expected to eliminate fatty aldehydes and negate aldehyde toxicity, improve the biochemical abnormalities and have clinical efficacy for SLS.\n\nThe primary objective of this clinical protocol is to determine whether ADX-629 is safe and tolerable for use in SLS subjects. The secondary objective is to determine the efficacy of ADX-629 in reversing the biochemical abnormalities in SLS. Exploratory objectives are to evaluate the short-term clinical effects of ADX-629 on neurologic, cutaneous and ophthalmologic disease in SLS. Patients will be treated with ADX-629 for 12 weeks and monitored for safety and biochemical efficacy.",
            "detailedDescription": "Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare inherited disorder of fatty aldehyde metabolism characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spastic diplegia, intellectual disability, seizures and a distinctive retinopathy. The disease is caused by bi-allelic mutations in ALDH3A2, which results in deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and leads to the build-up of harmful long-chain (C16-C20) aldehydes and alcohols. Accumulation of these lipids and their metabolic products in skin, brain and eyes is responsible for the symptoms, which persist lifelong. We hypothesize that elimination of fatty aldehydes using the oral pharmacologic aldehyde trapping agent ADX-629 will negate aldehyde toxicity, improve the biochemical abnormalities and have clinical efficacy for SLS patients.\n\nThis study is an open label, Phase 1/2, single center investigation of ADX-629 in SLS. The primary objective is to determine whether ADX-629 is safe and tolerable for use in SLS subjects. The secondary objective is to determine the efficacy of ADX-629 in reversing the biochemical abnormalities in SLS. Exploratory objectives are to evaluate the short-term clinical effects of ADX-629 on neurologic, cutaneous and ophthalmologic disease in SLS.\n\nUp to 10 subjects with genetically confirmed SLS who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled.\n\nAll subjects will be studied at the University of Nebraska Medical Center/Children's Hospital \\& Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Subjects will be treated with ADX-629 administered orally as 250 mg tablets for 12 weeks. Subjects will be monitored for safety of ADX-629 every 4 weeks by physical examination and biochemical safety tests.\n\nThe effects of ADX-629 on SLS-specific biomarkers will be determined after 12 weeks of drug treatment. Clinical tests will monitor neurological, dermatological and ophthalmologic response to drug."
