            "briefSummary": "This study examines how head and neck cancer treatment affects quality of sleep over time and factors that contribute to sleep quality. Sleep plays a critical role in healing and quality of life, and recent studies investigating sleep disorders in head and neck cancer patients reveal sleep quality is a major determinant of post-treatment outcomes. Information from this study may help researchers better understand how treatment impacts sleep quality so that they can make changes that may help improve patient sleep quality.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe the five (5) components of sleep quality in head and neck patients under different stages of post-op treatment and different environment.\n\nII. To evaluate the effect of surgery, treatment and environment on the five (5) components of sleep quality in head and neck cancer patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the association between the five (5) components of sleep quality and comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (STOP-BANG and Epworth Sleeping Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 \\[PHQ-2\\]), under different stages of post-op treatment and different environment.\n\nII. To evaluate the association between Fitbit actigraphy data (i.e. the 5th component of sleep quality) and the first 4 components of sleep quality for inpatients.\n\nIII. To compare the inpatient versus the outpatient responses on sleep hygiene at different time points of measurement.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess whether survey results warrant additional counseling or patient education.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nCOHORT 1-TP1: Patients complete surveys over 20 minutes on post-op day 3 and on day of discharge (or within 1 week).\n\nCOHORT 1-TP2: Patients complete surveys over 15 minutes at all regularly scheduled follow-up appointments (approximately 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months).\n\nCOHORT 2: Patients complete surveys over 15 minutes once."
