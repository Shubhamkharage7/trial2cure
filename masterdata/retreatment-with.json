Patients eligible for this protocol will have been treated initially with CTL019/CTL119 under UPCC13413/NCT02030834, have experienced a durable complete response (defined as \u2265 6 months duration), and have a residual manufactured CTL019/CTL119 product available. This protocol will serve subjects with no available potentially curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have a limited prognosis (months to \\< 2 year expected survival) with available therapies."
