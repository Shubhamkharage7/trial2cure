            "detailedDescription": "This study will be conducted in 3 Parts (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) and a total of approximately 48 male and female subjects will be enrolled.\n\nPart 1 will enroll approximately 16 subjects, aged 2 to less than 6 years to obtain information on PK and safety. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 (8 EXPAREL subjects and 8 bupivacaine HCl subjects) to receive either a single dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (not to exceed a maximum total dose of 266 mg) or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg (not to exceed a maximum total dose of 175 mg) using LIA. The overall PK and safety profiles from Part 1 will be completed, analyzed, and reviewed to establish an appropriate study drug dose for Part 2.\n\nSubject enrollment for Part 2 will commence upon complete enrollment of Part 1, establishment of an appropriate study drug dose from the PK, and safety analysis of Part 1 and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommendations to proceed to Part 2. Part 2 will enroll approximately 16 subjects, aged 6 months to less than 2 years to obtain information on PK and safety. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 (8 EXPAREL subjects and 8 bupivacaine HCl subjects) to receive either a single dose of EXPAREL or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl using LIA. The overall PK and safety profiles from Part 2 will be completed, analyzed, and reviewed to establish an appropriate study drug dose for Part 3.\n\nSubject enrollment for Part 3 will commence upon complete enrollment of Part 2, establishment of an appropriate study drug dose from the PK and safety analysis of Part 2, and DSMB recommendations to proceed to Part 3.\n\nPart 3 will enroll approximately 16 subjects aged 0 to less than 6 months to obtain information on PK and safety. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 (8 EXPAREL subjects and 8 bupivacaine HCL subjects) to receive either a single dose of EXPAREL or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl using LIA."
