            "briefSummary": "This phase II/III trial studies how well methylphenidate and exercise work in reducing cancer-related fatigue in patients with prostate cancer. Methylphenidate is a type of central nervous system stimulant that can improve cognitive ability, mainly in memory and cognitive function. Exercise can improve mood and the physical aspects of cancer-related fatigue. Giving methylphenidate in combination with exercise may work better in reducing cancer-related fatigue in patients with prostate cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the combination of exercise (EX) plus methylphenidate (MP) is superior to exercise plus placebo in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with prostate cancer scheduled to receive radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy for 12 weeks.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the effects of combined exercise plus methylphenidate on quality-of-life, mood, physical, and cognitive measures.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify potential synergistic effects of exercise and methylphenidate in improvement of CRF.\n\nII. To explore changes in brain activity by electroencephalography (EEG) in responders (with 4 point or greater change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue \\[FACIT-F\\] scores) versus (vs) non-responders to the intervention.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive methylphenidate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and undergo exercise program consisting of resistance training twice weekly (BIW) and walking 15- 40 minutes a day 4 days a week for 12 weeks.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive a placebo PO BID and undergo exercise program consisting of resistance training BIW and walking 15-40 minutes a day for 4 days a week for 12 weeks.\n\nGROUP III: Patients receive methylphenidate PO BID and undergo stretching for 4 days a week for 12 weeks.\n\nGROUP IV: Patients receive a placebo PO BID and undergo stretching for 4 days a week for 12 weeks.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months."
