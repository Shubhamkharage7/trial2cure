            "briefSummary": "The proposed project is based on the observation that schizophrenia is characterized by a chronic pro-inflammatory state, which contributes to the severity of a number of the clinical manifestations of the illness, including cognitive impairments, the treatment of which represents a critically important unmet therapeutic need.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators hypothesize that the level of inflammation in people with schizophrenia can be reduced through the use of the prebiotic: Prebiotin\u00ae, an oligofructose-enriched inulin (OEI), to stimulate the activity of butyrate-producing bacteria and increase the production of butyrate, which has multiple anti-inflammatory properties. The investigators will confirm the effect of prebiotic administration on the biological signature and examine whether increased serum butyrate levels are associated with changes in cognitive performance (primary specific aim), symptoms, and metabolic measures; and the extent to which these associations are mediated by the anti-inflammatory properties of butyrate, including the ability of butyrate to decrease gut permeability and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and/or changes in gut microbiota composition.\n\nIn a sample of participants with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the investigators will conduct a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to confirm the effect of prebiotic administration on the biological signature and examine whether increased serum butyrate levels are associated with changes in cognitive performance, symptoms, and metabolic measures; and the extent to which these associations are mediated by the anti-inflammatory properties of butyrate, including the ability of butyrate to decrease gut permeability and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and/or changes in gut microbiota composition."
