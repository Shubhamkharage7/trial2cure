            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial determines if the combination of ONC201 with different drugs, panobinostat or paxalisib, is effective for treating participants with diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). Despite years of research, little to no progress has been made to improve outcomes for participants with DMGs, and there are few treatment options. ONC201, panobinostat, and paxalisib are all enzyme inhibitors that may stop the growth of tumor cells by clocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase II trial assesses different combinations of these drugs for the treatment of DMGs.",
