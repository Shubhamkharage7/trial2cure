            "detailedDescription": "The purpose is to restrict venous outflow with an inflatable cuff to create a high intensity environment increases muscle hypertrophy, thus promoting a more efficient form of rehabilitation. Blood flow restriction therapy is a blood pressure cuff placed around the desired limb with a handheld device that controls the pressure exerted by the cuff. The cuff is placed around the desired limb before a specific exercise, the physical therapist determines the appropriate pressure and time, and the patient completes the exercise as they normally would. The monitor determines the limb occlusion pressure and has an automatic timer that will deflate after the specified time has elapsed. There are also audio and visual alarms that alert the user of under or over pressurization. The specific pressure will vary based on patient's tolerance and will stay consistent through each exercise. Thus far blood flow restriction therapy has been tested in patients with several pathologies but there is limited literature on its effect on lower limb extensor injuries."
