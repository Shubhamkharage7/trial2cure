The study will be separated into two distinct phases designated as Phase 1 and Phase 2.\n\nAfter the safety and tolerability of ONCT-808 have been assessed to select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Phase 1, Phase 2 will commence to further validate the dose and evaluate the safety and efficacy of ONCT-808. In Phase 2, subjects with LBCL or MCL will be enrolled into 2 separate dose expansion cohorts."
