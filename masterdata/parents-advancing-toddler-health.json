            "briefSummary": "Although early interventions can improve health equity in young children living in poverty, this promise often is not realized because of barriers to family engagement. The proposed study will target co-morbid behavior and sleep problems in early childhood, comparing child outcomes and family response to sleep and behavior interventions and investigating the novel strategy of letting families select their intervention.We will enroll 500 low-income toddlers with co-morbid sleep and behavior problems, randomized to 4 parent coaching interventions: sleep, behavior, family choice (sleep or behavior), and an active control. At baseline and at 1, 5, and 9 months post- intervention, we will assess child sleep and behavior and family functioning. We will measure family preference, engagement, and perceived value of each intervention. The goals of the study are: (1) to examine effects of evidence- based sleep and behavior interventions in young low-income children with co-morbid sleep and behavior problems on child sleep and behavior and family functioning; (2) to determine whether parents prefer, engage with, and value a sleep or behavior intervention more; and (3) to examine if giving families a choice of intervention results in higher engagement, higher perceived value and better family and child outcomes than assignment to intervention. By informing best practices for engaging low-income families to treat co-morbid sleep and behavior problems, results will be critical to reducing health disparities for children living in poverty.",
            "detailedDescription": "Children living in poverty have a high incidence of early-developing sleep and behavior problems, which are often co-morbid. Early sleep and behavior problems are prevalent and persistent risk factors for lifelong poor mental and physical health outcomes, and may be key mechanisms underlying early and enduring socioeconomic health disparities. While effective interventions exist, low-income families have low enrollment and retention in these interventions. Stigma of treating behavior problems creates an additional barrier to treatment. This RCT aims to address these barriers to treatment for low-income children with co-morbid sleep and behavior problems. Sleep and behavior problems and family dysfunction transact across time, increasing in severity, while healthy sleep, positive child behaviors, and effective parenting can support each other across development. Thus we posit that intervention in one domain, either sleep or behavior, may improve outcomes both within and across domains.\n\nThe proposed study is a parallel randomized controlled trial of behavioral treatments for sleep problems and behavior problems in early childhood. The current study will test our three key aims: that evidence based sleep and behavior interventions each will improve trajectories from early comorbid sleep and behavior problems to healthier outcomes (Aim 1); that family preference, engagement, and value may differ for sleep vs. behavior interventions (Aim 2); and that families who choose between sleep and behavior interventions will have a more positive family response and better outcomes than those assigned to an intervention (Aim 3). This study will enroll 500 low income children ages 24 to 48 months with comorbid sleep and behavior problems. Children will be recruited at Boston University and the University of Denver. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of four intervention arms, Behavior (FCU), Sleep (SHIP), Choice (FCU or SHIP, as selected by primary caregiver), and active Control (Oral Health, Child Safety, and Environmental Health). For those assigned to Choice, the primary caregiver will be provided information about FCU and SHIP and will select their preferred intervention.\n\nAt the baseline evaluation (T1) all participants will undergo the following procedures: a) An evaluation of child behavior b) an evaluation of child sleep c) an evaluation of family functioning. Following the baseline evaluation all participants will engage in 8 sessions of parent coaching intervention over a 2 month period, with the content of the intervention varying by intervention arm, see descriptions below. The SHIP and FCU have similar structure, emphasizing motivational interviewing and support for parent goals. Paraprofessional staff at each site will be trained to deliver the FCU, SHIP, and Control interventions.\n\nThe measures included in the T1 baseline evaluation will be repeated at 1 and 5 months post intervention, T2 and T3. At T4, 9 months post intervention, primary caregiver report of child behavior and sleep symptoms and family functioning will be collected via telephone interview."
