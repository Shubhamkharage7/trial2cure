            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nelfinavir when given together with cisplatin and external beam radiation therapy in treating patients with vulvar cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery. Nelfinavir is an antiviral drug normally used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nelfinavir, cisplatin, and external beam radiation therapy may work better than giving only cisplatin and external beam radiation therapy in treating patients with vulvar cancer.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and dose limiting toxicities of nelfinavir in combination with cisplatin plus inguinal +/-pelvic radiation therapy for treatment of patients with unresectable T2-4, N0-3 vulvar carcinoma.\n\nII. To determine the recommended phase II dose of nelfinavir combined with chemoradiotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine recurrence site (local/distant), progression-free survival and overall survival.\n\nII. To determine the levels of Akt activity (and downstream effectors such as pGSK3, pEBP1) and p16INK4A in addition to the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18, and E6/E7 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in vulvar biopsy specimens of patients at up to two(2) different time points (1. pre nelfinavir, pre-radiation, 2. while on nelfinavir, pre-radiation).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nelfinavir orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 8 weeks. Starting week 2, patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes once weekly during weeks 2-8. Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for 5 consecutive days between weeks 2-8. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 1 year."
