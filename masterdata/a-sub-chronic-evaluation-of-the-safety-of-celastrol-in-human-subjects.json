            "briefSummary": "This is an open label safety study that will not be blinded or placebo controlled.\n\nPurpose is to evaluate the safety of Celastrol in healthy men and women volunteers, between 18 and 40 years of age, over a 90-day period.\n\nCelastrol is different than Cholesterol. Cholesterol is a risk for heart disease. Celastrol is a natural occurring compound extracted from the root of Tripterygium wilfordii, a herb used in Chinese medicine.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pre-study Visit A pre-study visit will occur approximately one week before the scheduled beginning of the study. At this time all nutritional supplements must be stopped. During this visit, the subjects will sign an Informed Consent, will provide a medical history and list their concurrent medications. They will have a physical exam and then have a blood sample taken and receive an EKG. Women of child-bearing age will provide a urine sample to test for pregnancy. The subjects will then have their eligibility assessed based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\nStudy Visit 1, Day 0 The subjects who meet the entrance criteria will arrive at the clinic at an appointed time, and will again have their concurrent medications reviewed. They will be assigned a unique study number and be given a vial of experimental product that contains the same number as the subject, and contains ten capsules of product. Each capsule will contain \\~67 mg of Celastrol. Instructions on how and when to take the experimental product will be given to the subjects by the clinician. A log book or an electronic portal will be presented to each subject so that daily information, such as the day and time of product ingestion, and any self-perceived adverse events, will be recorded. Any self-perceived adverse events experienced prior to taking any product should be told to the clinician at this time.\n\nThe subjects will be instructed to bring their drug vials to every clinic visit so that compliance can be determined. Any subject who has less than an 80% compliance rate will be excused from the study.\n\nStudy Visit 2, Day 2 To test for any acute effects of the experimental product, the subjects will return to the clinic on day 2 of the study. A blood sample will be taken, the log-book and vial will be reviewed for compliance, concurrent medications and any self-perceived adverse events will be discussed. Their vials that were given on Study Day 1 will contain enough remaining experimental product capsules to support the study to Day 7. Three extra capsules will be provided in the event that the subject cannot return to the clinic on the exact day indicated.\n\nStudy Visit 3, Day 7 The subjects will return to the clinic on Day 7, and a blood sample will be taken. As before, the log-book and vial will be reviewed for compliance, and concurrent medications and any self-perceived adverse events will be discussed. A vial containing enough experimental product, plus three additional capsules, to last another 7 days will be given.\n\nStudy Visit 4, Day 14 The clinic visit on Day 14 will mimic the visit on Day 7. However, during this visit the subjects will also receive a physical exam with vital signs, and an EKG. A vial containing enough product to last until Day 28 (Visit 5), plus 5 additional capsules, will be given to each subject.\n\nStudy Visits 5 and 6, Days 28 and 58 The clinic visits on Days 28 and 58 will again mimic the visit on Day 7. No EKGs will be taken. On Day 28, vials containing enough product, plus 5 additional capsules, to last to day 58 (Visit 6) will be given to each subject.\n\nStudy Visit 7, Day 88 The final clinic visit will consist of a physical exam with vital signs, a blood sample, and an EKG. The logbook and vial will be reviewed for compliance, and concurrent medications and any self-perceived adverse events will be discussed. At this point the study is complete and the subjects are released."
