ER-Y is a single-session pain management class for youth focused on pain science education and teaching self-regulatory skills for pain management based on the evidence-based adult ER class. Feasibility and acceptability of ER-Y will be assessed post-class. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by administering surveys at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks post class.",
            "detailedDescription": "The current proposed, single-arm, uncontrolled pilot study will determine a) feasibility of ER-Y in youth with chronic pain, b) patients' perceptions and satisfaction of the ER-Y class and c) preliminary efficacy to inform the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial."
