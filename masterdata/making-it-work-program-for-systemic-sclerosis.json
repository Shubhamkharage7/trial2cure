The program is called Making it Work Systemic Sclerosis.\n\nResearchers will compare a group who gets the program to a group who will get the program at a later point in time (wait list control group) to see if self-confidence in dealing with work challenge gets better.\n\nPeople in the Making it Work group will complete questionnaires and attend one 2 hour meetings each week for 5 weeks and meet with an occupational therapist and vocational counselor. People in the wait list control group will complete the questionnaires and participate in the program at a later point in time."
