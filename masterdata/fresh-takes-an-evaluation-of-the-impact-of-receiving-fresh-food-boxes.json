            "briefSummary": "Fresh Takes! is a targeted food distribution and nutrition education program offered by Montefiore Bronx Health Collective, a Federally Qualified Health Center located in the South Bronx. The goal of Fresh Takes! is to help reduce food insecurity and prevent progressions to overt diabetes in patients with prediabetes and to help patients with overt diabetes achieve better diabetic control. To that end, participants receive bimonthly fresh food boxes and nutritional support and education over the course of a six-month program.",
            "detailedDescription": "Diabetes affects approximately one in 10 individuals in the United States and is associated with cardiovascular disease, nerve and retinal damage, and kidney disease. In 2019, it was reported to be the 7th leading cause of death nationally. Unfortunately, diabetes disproportionally affects people of color, those of heavier weight, and those with lower incomes. All of these characteristics are common in residents of the communities served by Montefiore Bronx Health Collective (BHC). Enrolling patients in care at BHC with prediabetes or overt diabetes into Fresh Takes! has the potential to improve short term outcomes and reduce the risk of developing diabetes-associated comorbidities for a highly vulnerable population. The 6-month program has three major components: 1) receipt of a fresh food box twice each month, 2) group nutrition education provided at the time of bimonthly food pickup, and 3) individualized support by a dietician. One of the unique aspects of Fresh Takes! is the provision of a fresh food box to participants. Healthier dietary patterns have been found to be associated with significantly lower risk of developing diabetes and better glycemic control among individuals with diabetes. Yet, little research to date has been conducted on the impact of providing fresh fruits and vegetables on diabetic control for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes."
