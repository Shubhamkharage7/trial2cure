The study aims to adapt STAIR-NT to a massed treatment schedule. Once an adapted protocol is complete, it will be tested for feasibility, acceptability, and short-term polysubstance and PTSD symptomology outcomes in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) of 80 participants. Participants who screen eligible and consent will be randomized 1:1 to the adapted STAIR-NT intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) using randomization blocks of two and two and four via a computer-generated randomization sequence. Participants assigned to the intervention will receive the adapted massed delivery of STAIR-NT by trained counselors."
