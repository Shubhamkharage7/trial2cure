Increasing communication between doctors and patients with breast cancer may help patients to better follow recommendations on taking adjuvant hormonal treatment medication. A telephone-based intervention may help to increase doctor-patient communication and patients' adherence to their prescribed medication.",

Pilot test intervention effects on adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) and explore trends in the adherence outcomes by demographic and psychosocial factors defined as acceptance, continuation, and adherence.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Feasibility of study design defined as recruitment rate, rate of using intervention as instructed, rate of protocol completion, and completion of psycho-social questionnaires which have been associated with adherence to AHT in the existing literature (i.e., depression, social support, pain, stress, fatigue, quality of life, pill taking attitude and behavior, perceived risk of breast cancer recurrence).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Surveying patients and physicians regarding their comments on the intervention components (i.e., video, text messaging, and app \\[application\\]) and overall study participation.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive daily text messages reminding them to take AHT and weekly interactive surveys delivered by a smart phone app for 3 months."
