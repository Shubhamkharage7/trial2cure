Oncology providers will receive the mPal intervention. mPal is designed to help oncology providers integrate outpatient palliative care (non-hospice palliative care; NHPC) into routine clinical practice through: 1) electronic health record enhancements; 2) patient education and preparation for NHPC discussions when patients are in clinic to see their oncology providers; and 3) provider education about NHPC.\n\nThis study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of mPal and gather preliminary data on potential outcomes for a future effectiveness trial."
