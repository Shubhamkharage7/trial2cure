            "detailedDescription": "Existing data supports a potential role and synergistic activity between TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors and PD1 TGF-\u03b2 has been investigated in ovarian cancer and it is suggested to play a dominant role as a potent inducer of ovarian cancer invasiveness and metastasis in additional studies \\[36\\]. In fact, TGF-\u03b2 ligand and TGF-\u03b2 receptor I and II are strongly expressed in ovarian tumors especially high-grade ovarian cancers. Further, TGF-\u03b2 is abundantly secreted into the tumor microenvironment by cancer and stromal cells in this cancer. TGF-\u03b2 expression has been shown to significantly higher in ovarian cancer tissue especially advanced stage disease compared to healthy tissue or borderline tumors. Inhibiting senescence in the immune compartment may have a profound effect on the cytotoxic functions of both innate and adaptive immune cells. This study aims to examine markers of senescence on immune cells obtained from blood throughout the proposed trial. We hypothesize that HCW9218 will act as a senolytic by \"trapping\" excess TGF-\u03b2, therefore inhibiting its ability to promote senescence. We believe that this combined with the immune activating effect of IL-15 will be a biologically relevant therapeutic with potential to at least partially reverse therapy induced senescence (TIS) or in the future, perhaps have an effect even on physiologic aging."

Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\nNote: Patients who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n\nPrior/Concomitant Therapy:\n\n1. Has received prior therapy with a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, IL-15 or analogs.\n2. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents prior to treatment. Note: Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to \u2264Grade 1 or baseline. Patients with \u2264Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Note: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.\n3. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Patients must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u22642 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n4. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n5. Known severe hypersensitivity (Grade \u2265 3 NCI CTCAE 5.0) to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the investigational product used in the study or any component in its formulations, any history of anaphylaxis, or recent, within 5 months, history of uncontrollable asthma.\n6. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention.\n\nNote: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.\n\nMedical conditions:\n\n1. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study drug.\n2. Has a history of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been completed with no evidence of malignancy for 2 years.\n\n   Note: The time requirement does not apply to participants who underwent successful definitive resection of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other in-situ cancers\n3. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\n4. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.\n5. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n6. Has an active infection requiring systemic intravenous therapy.\n7. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or HIV test (+) in screening test. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority. Patients with HIV infection with following exception are allowed: HIV-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of enrollment are eligible for this trial.\n8. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection except following situation: Patients with a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection are allowed to be included if: participant on a stable dose of antiviral therapy, HBV viral load below the limit of quantification. HCV viral load below the limit of quantification.\n9. Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB).\n10. History of bleeding diathesis or recent major bleeding events (i.e., Grade \u2265 2 bleeding event the month prior treatment).\n11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III/IV), uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265150/90mmHg), unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (\u2264 6 months prior to screening), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, clinically significant cardiac valvulopathy requiting treatment, active interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.\n12. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \u2265450 ms in male and \u2265470 ms in female calculated from 12-lead ECGs.\n13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n15. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.",
