Treatment Period 1: Ensifentrine; Treatment Period 2: Placebo.\n2. Treatment Period 1: Placebo; Treatment Period 2: Ensifentrine.\n\nAll participants will take study supplied albuterol (to use as-needed) as well as a once daily COPD Maintenance Therapy during study participation.\n\nThe total duration of study participation is 22-24 weeks:\n\n* Screening and Run-in Period: 2-4 weeks; participants will be screened for eligibility before entering a run-in period to ensure a stable background on a once daily COPD Maintenance Therapy.\n* Treatment Period 1: 8 weeks; participants completing the Run-in Period and meeting all entry and Randomization Criteria will be randomized to 8 weeks of treatment with blinded, nebulized ensifentrine or placebo + once daily COPD Maintenance Therapy.\n* Washout Period: 4 weeks; patients will only take once daily COPD Maintenance Therapy. There will be a follow-up phone call about 1 week after finishing Treatment Period 1.\n* Treatment Period 2: 8 weeks of treatment with Study Medication (opposite of Treatment Period 1) + once daily COPD Maintenance Therapy.\n* Safety follow-up: 1 week after Treatment Period 2\n\nThere are 7 scheduled in-clinic visits: Screening visit + three visits within each treatment period. There is an end of treatment safety telephone follow-up call about 1 week after each treatment period. Participants will have telephone reminders between in-clinic visits."

Asymptomatic patients with a positive COVID-19 test result indicating an active infection \\< 30 days prior to Screening or at Screening may be re-screened for eligibility after 30 days (or in accordance with local requirements).\n\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2265 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and/or bilirubin \\> 1.5 x ULN (isolated bilirubin \\>1.5 x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin \\<35%).
