            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial is being conducted by investigators who are colorectal surgeons. Eligible study participants will receive the experimental treatment E-CEL UVEC cells by direct injection into the anal fissure. The study is being conducted to determine if E-CEL UVEC cell injections will be safe and would have any effects on healing of the anal fissure.",
            "detailedDescription": "This Phase 1b trial is conducted to evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of local (percutaneous) injections of E-CEL UVEC cells, genetically-engineered (pro-survival gene, E4ORF1+), human umbilical vein endothelial cells, as an experimental treatment of patients with chronic anal fissure (CAF) who have failed medical therapy (i.e., topical vasodilators \u00b1 botulinum injection). The study is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm study, meaning every study participant will receive some dose of the experimental study drug (no placebo). Consented, eligible participants will receive percutaneous injections of E-CEL UVEC cell product along the sides of the fissure; the treatments are spaced 3 to 4 weeks apart. Initial safety and efficacy parameters will be observed over a 6-month period, followed by a long-term follow-up consisting of annual questionnaire provided by electronic means.\n\nThis research study is being done because, in animal studies, E-CEL UVEC cells have been shown to aid in restoring or accelerating the normal healing in various tissues. This study will test if it is safe to use E-CEL UVEC cell therapy and if they it would aid in restoring or improve healing of CAF that was not responding to medical therapy. This study is being led by Dr. Kelly Garrett, Associate Professor of Surgery, and conducted by surgeons in the Colon and Rectal Surgery Division of Weill Cornell Medical College."
