Determine the exposure ranges (harmful and potentially harmful constituents \\[HPHCs\\], other toxicants) from vaping e-liquids with and without the presence of synthetic cooling agents.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants attend 4 sessions where they receive 1 of 4 randomly assigned flavored e-cigarettes. Participants use the e cigarettes for vaping followed by ad libitum vaping. Participants also complete surveys and undergo biosample collection throughout the study."
