The light is to be used each evening in the home for 1 hour, while the participant watches TV, eats dinner, reads, etc. The primary outcome measure is the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 Summary Index (PDQ-39SI). The PDQ-39 is a patient-reported, quality of life scale. The key secondary endpoint is Parts 1 and 2 of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 and 2 measure non-motor and motor function in Parkinson's. Participants will be assessed via online videoconferences."
