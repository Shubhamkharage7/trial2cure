            "briefSummary": "This study compares the effectiveness of technology-enhanced collaborative care management (t-CoCM) to usual collaborative care management (u-CoCM) in achieving fidelity to processes of care and reducing depression symptoms in patients currently receiving cancer treatment. CoCM is a population-based, integrated care approach, where care managers, who are clinicians (typically clinical social workers), deliver behavioral treatments, coordinate psychosocial care, monitor outcomes, and adjust treatment with the input of a psychiatric consultant. The use of t-CoCM may improve the treatment of depression and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.",

Patients complete surveys at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Some patients also participate in an interview or focus group about their user experience with the t-CoCM digital platform. Care managers also participate in interviews or focus groups regarding their experience with CoCM and the newly developed web-based platform.\n\nARM II (u-CoCM): Patients receive usual care and clinic care managers deliver usual CoCM.
