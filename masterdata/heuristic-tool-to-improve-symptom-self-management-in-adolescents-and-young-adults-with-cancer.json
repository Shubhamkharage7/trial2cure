Users select symptoms they have experienced over the past week, rate each symptom's severity and distress, and name a perceived cause. They then identify temporal and causal relationships between symptoms using lines and arrows, designate groups, i.e., \"clusters\" of symptoms, and give a name to each cluster. They are asked the reason for a symptom's designation as a priority symptom and what they do to alleviate that symptom. Next, they are asked to designate a priority cluster and finally, to confirm whether the image accurately reflects their symptom experience. Then, at the clinic visit, the AYA shares the visual image with the HCP, and more importantly, their priority symptoms, which can facilitate the symptom discussion. The C-SCAT intervention group will complete the C-SCAT prior to each of three encounters with their health care providers (HCPs).",
