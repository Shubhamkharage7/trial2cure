            "detailedDescription": "The therapeutic approach taken by this clinical trial may offer patients a therapeutic benefit after failure of standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n\nPatients giving written informed consent will undergo screening during the Pretreatment Period to determine eligibility for trial entry. The Pretreatment Period will include collection and recording of medical history, concomitant medications, baseline symptoms, previous therapies, and baseline assessments. The patient's baseline tumor burden will be recorded with radiological assessments, along with analyzing location and size of tumors to identify and characterize target tumor(s) that will be treated and/or followed during the clinical trial.\n\nIf confirmed eligible for the study, the patient will advance into the Treatment Period. During the Treatment Period, patients will receive a routine radiofrequency ablation (RFA), followed by an injection of investigational product (IP-001 for Injection) into the tumor. Patients can be treated every 6 weeks for up to 4 treatments with RFA + IP-001 for Injection.\n\nA patient will move to the 6-month Follow-up Period when the patient has completed 4 treatment cycles or if the decision is made that no subsequent treatments will be administered. During the Follow-up Period, there will be a Follow-up Visit every 6 weeks for 5 visits, at disease progression, or prior to the start of a new antineoplastic treatment."
