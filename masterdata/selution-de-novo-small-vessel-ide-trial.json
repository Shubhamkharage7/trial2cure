A minimum of 50% of the subjects will be enrolled in the US.",

A minimum of 50% of the subjects will be enrolled in the US.\n\nSubjects who present with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), unstable angina or stabilized non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with an indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with planned intervention for de novo lesions in small coronary vessels (RVD 2.00 mm to 2.75 mm) and meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to treatment of the identified target lesion with either the SELUTION SLR 014 PTCA DEB or contemporary DES.\n\nRandomized Cohort:\n\n* Intervention (DEB Strategy): Subjects randomized to the SELUTION SLR 014 PTCA DEB arm will receive lesion preparation according to the 3rd drug coated balloon (DCB) consensus (optimal balloon angioplasty with adjunct treatment using high-pressure balloon, intravascular lithotripsy, laser, rotational or orbital atherectomy, cutting or scoring balloon at the discretion of the operator as needed to reduce diameter stenosis to \u2264 30%). Subjects with lesions that are then best treated by provisional stenting (flow-limiting dissection, residual stenosis \\> 30%) will receive a DES instead of the SELUTION DEB but remain in the SELUTION DEB group (intention to treat analysis). The DEB should not be used after DES implant.\n* Control (DES): Subjects randomized to the DES arm will receive treatment using any FDA approved \"limus-based\" DES, as per standard institutional practice.\n\nAngiographic Substudy:\n\nThe angiographic substudy is a parallel registry consisting of up to 30 additional consecutive subjects meeting all eligibility criteria treated with the SELUTION DEB recruited at select study sites. These subjects will undergo angiography at 12 months post-procedure. Clinical follow-up will not extend beyond 12 months in this cohort.\n\nPharmacokinetic (pK) Substudy:\n\nThe pKsubstudy is a parallel registry consisting of up to 20 additional consecutive subjects meeting all eligibility criteria treated with the SELUTION DEB recruited at select study sites. This study will be conducted under an approved substudy protocol and will include blood draws at regular intervals to characterize the pK plasma profile of sirolimus.\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nTarget lesion failure (TLF), defined as the composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction (MI) or clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months. MI includes spontaneous (Type 1) MI using the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI) and peri-procedural MI using the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) definition."
