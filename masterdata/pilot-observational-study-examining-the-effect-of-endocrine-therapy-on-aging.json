Participants will be treated with standard of care aromatase inhibitor therapy and will undergo serial phlebotomy, complete patient-reported questionnaires, and submit serial stool samples.\n\nThe main exploratory translational questions it aims to obtain preliminary data for are:\n\n* What are the effects of aromatase inhibitor therapy on biomarkers of aging?\n* What are the effects of aromatase inhibitor therapy on the microbiome? These data will be used for the development of future definitive studies."
