            "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this study is to conduct a longitudinal observational study to investigate the association of early OPC with the onset and severity of S-ECC to better understand the role of Candida (particularly C. albicans) in severe childhood caries. The investigators will test the hypothesis that OPC is associated with S-ECC by modifying the plaque microbiota and enhancing virulence in a manner that is conducive to the early development of the disease.\n\nFor this study, a total of 70 infants (aged 9-15-month-old) with or without a history of OPC in their first year of life will be enrolled, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will have their medical/dental history reviewed from medical records. At each study visit (Baseline, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month follow-ups), an oral examination including soft tissue and caries exam will be performed by a calibrated evaluator. Dental plaque/oral swab samples will be collected at each study visit. In addition, a comprehensive survey including demographic status, oral hygiene, diet, delivery, and feeding method as well as current medication usage will also be collected."
