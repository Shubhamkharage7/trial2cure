MZP has already successfully been used in the treatment of methamphetamine (detailed further below and in the Appendices).\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that those assigned to the MZP plus treatment as usual (TAU) MZP+TAU arm will demonstrate significantly increased rates of biochemically verified abstinence from MA and other substances of abuse and experience improvements in health impairing behaviors relative to the placebo (PLO)+TAU arm across the 10-week treatment and follow-up periods."
