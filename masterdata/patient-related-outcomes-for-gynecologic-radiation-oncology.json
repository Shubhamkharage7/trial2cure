However, PROM are not routinely collected for gynecological cancer patients at UNC, and fewer studies have specifically focused on PROM for gynecological cancer patients receiving radiation. The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of PRO monitoring of gynecologic symptoms before, during (at weekly intervals), and after radiation (external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy) for gynecologic cancer patients at a high volume center."
