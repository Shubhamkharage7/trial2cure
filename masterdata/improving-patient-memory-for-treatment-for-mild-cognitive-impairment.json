            "detailedDescription": "People experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may benefit from adding memory support to treatment-as-usual. Adding memory support may be an innovative way to improve patient memory for treatment, adherence to treatment and outcome.\n\nThe key question is: What types of memory support are most potent for MCI patients relative to non-MCI patients?\n\nThe aim of the proposed research is to assess patient memory for treatment and the impact of adding memory support for people who are and are not experiencing MCI. The investigators will also compare the effectiveness of constructive vs. non-constructive memory supports for people who are experiencing MCI compared to people who are not experiencing MCI.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. Recall of the content of treatment will be lower in the MCI group relative to the non-MCI group.\n2. Constructive memory support will be more effective for the non-MCI group relative to the MCI group.\n3. Non-constructive memory support will be more effective for the MCI group relative to the non-MCI group.\n\nThe outcomes are: (1) patient memory for the content of treatment session and (2) the number and accuracy of thoughts and applications of the therapy points delivered. The investigators will also collect ratings of the acceptability of the treatment and the memory supports that are delivered.\n\nThis dataset will also be used to better understand the sleep and circadian challenges that people with and without MCI report via the SCID for sleep disorders and the PROMIS scales."
