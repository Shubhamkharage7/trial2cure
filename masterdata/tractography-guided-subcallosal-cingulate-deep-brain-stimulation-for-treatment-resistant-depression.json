            "briefSummary": "Treatment resistant depression remains a major problem for individuals and society. Surgical procedures may provide relief for some of these patients. The most frequently considered surgical approach is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a part of the brain called the subcallosal cingulate region. However, the effectiveness and safety is not well established. The investigators will use a novel approach using advanced imaging technique (magnetic resonance tractography) to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this surgical approach. An innovative method for the definition of DBS target will be applied that redefines the concept of targeting as one of targeting a symptomatic network rather than a structural brain region using subject-based brain anatomy to define the target location. The correlation between imaging findings at baseline with the mood score changes at different time points of the study will be investigated."

The non-responders, after the open label period (12 months) will have monthly follow-up visits for 12 mo. During the discontinuation period, patients will be randomized to either the ON or OFF stimulation phase for 3 mo each. If randomized to ON, there will be no change for 3 mo, then a biweekly 25% reduction in stimulation amplitude for the next 3 mo until stimulation is off. If randomization to OFF phase, there will be an initial biweekly 25% reduction in stimulation amplitude for 3 mo until the device is off then the stimulation settings will be turned back to the optimized settings for three months.",
