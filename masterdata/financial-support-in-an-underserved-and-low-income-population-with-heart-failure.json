            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test whether financial support in the form of a one-time $500 stipend would improve medication adherence and quality of life in low-income, socially-needy patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the post-discharge setting. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will financial support improve heart failure quality of life?\n* Will financial support improve medication adherence?\n\nParticipants will complete surveys on quality of life, social stress, and spending habits at their baseline visit. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive $500 at their baseline visit or $0 at their baseline visit. At their one month visit, quality of life and medication adherence will be assessed. These results will be compared between groups. The group that received $0 at their baseline visit will be provided $500 at their one-month visit and return for a two-month visit. At that visit, quality of life and medication adherence will be assessed. These results will be compared to their one-month results.\n\nResearchers will compare the 1-month quality of life scores and medication adherence scores between the immediate financial support vs delayed financial support. Researchers will also compare 1-month vs 2-month quality of life and adherence data for participants who were randomized to the delayed financial support group."
