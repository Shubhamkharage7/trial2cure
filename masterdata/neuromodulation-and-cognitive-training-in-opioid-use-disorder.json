            "briefSummary": "The relapsing nature of opioid use disorder is a major obstacle to successful treatment. About 90% of those entering treatment will relapse within one year. To improve treatment outcome, new interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers of relapse vulnerability hold significant promise in reducing this critical public health problem. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modulate brain connectivity.",
            "detailedDescription": "Cognitive flexibility, the ability to change maladaptive behavior, depends on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) input to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; Gruber, Hussain, and O'Donnell 2009). DLPFC stimulation may increase input to NAcc to facilitate proper selection of goal-directed behavior and may also decrease craving in individuals with substance use disorder (Boggio et al. 2008).\n\nWe will use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the DLPFC. TDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modulate brain connectivity. TDCS involves applying a weak electrical current (2mA or less) to the scalp via anodal and cathodal electrode sponges, causing either increases or decreases in cortical excitability, respectively. Research has shown in both healthy subjects and patients (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression) that tDCS has the potential to modulate synaptic strengthening and neurotransmitter-dependent plasticity underlying changes in behavior and learning (Lang et al. 2005).\n\nWe are anticipating enrollment of 30 participants. Fifteen participants will be randomly assigned to the interventional tDCS condition, while 15 participants will be randomly assigned to sham tDCS. Both conditions will undergo five sessions of tDCS across five days. Participants will undergo pre- and post-tDCS MRI scans, in addition to clinical interviews and questionnaires. Follow-up interviews will be conducted in person 1 and 2 months after intervention completion to inquire about relapse status."
