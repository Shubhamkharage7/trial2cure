During Phase 1, participants will self-administer two TAF/EVG or placebo rectal inserts for 3 consecutive days and return to the clinic at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the last dose for biological sample collection. During Phase 2, participants will administer two TAF/EVG or placebo rectal inserts every other day for 7 doses and return to the clinic at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after the final dose for biological sample collection. There will be a washout period of 7 to 28 days between the study phases."
