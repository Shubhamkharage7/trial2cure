Contingency management is a behavioral intervention in which participants receive incentives (rewards) when they complete planned tasks that are consistent with their recovery efforts. House staff members will also participate in this study and will be trained to provide contingency management to residents. The investigators will compare recovery houses that implement contingency management to matched houses that do not, and the main outcomes will be engagement in the planned activities and retention in the recovery houses. Participants will receive contingency management for up to 12 weeks and follow-up will occur 6 months post-treatment."
