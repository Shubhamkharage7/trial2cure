            "briefSummary": "Poor sleep quality is very common in modern society. Walnuts contain many nutrients that may be helpful for sleep, including melatonin and polyphenols. Some studies show that eating foods high in melatonin and polyphenols improves sleep quality, but walnuts have not been studied specifically. This study proposes to test if eating walnuts improves sleep compared to a food that lacks these sleep-promoting factors. The investigators expect that walnut consumption for 4 days will increase melatonin levels and lead to better sleep quality compared to a high-carbohydrate, high-sugar food. The study will enroll middle-aged and older adults with sleep complaints to participate in this study. Each person will eat the two different foods for 4 days each in random order. The 4-day periods will be separated by at least 2-3 weeks. Sleep quality will be measured by questionnaire and with a wrist monitor every day. The investigators will also do a sleep study using electroencephalography (EEG) on night 3 and take measures of circadian physiology (natural body rhythms) in the laboratory on day 4 (including overnight) by measuring body temperature and blood and urine melatonin. The study findings may provide new options to improve sleep health from increased walnut consumption.",
            "detailedDescription": "Walnuts are a nutrient-rich food which provides melatonin and polyphenols. While there is evidence that dietary intakes of foods high in melatonin and polyphenols positively influence sleep quality, the effect of walnuts has not been investigated. The investigators propose to fill this knowledge gap by testing the effects of walnut consumption on serum melatonin and resulting sleep and circadian biology. The study hypotheses are that walnut consumption for 4 days will increase melatonin levels, suggestive of more robust circadian rhythms, and lead to better sleep quality compared to a high-carbohydrate high-sugar (HCHS) equivalent. Using a randomized controlled crossover trial, the study aims to: 1) determine the effect of walnut vs HCHS consumption on melatonin levels; and 2) determine the effect of walnut vs HCHS consumption on sleep and circadian physiology. Adult males and females with poor sleep quality will consume three servings/day of walnuts or an equicaloric HCHS food for 4 days. Sleep quality will be measured nightly using the Karolinska Sleep Diary and wrist actigraphy; sleep architecture from polysomnography will be measured on night 3. Circadian physiology will be assessed on day 4 using body temperature and hourly serum melatonin and on the morning of day 5 from overnight urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. Given the extent of poor sleep, our findings may open new avenues to improve sleep health from increased walnut consumption."
