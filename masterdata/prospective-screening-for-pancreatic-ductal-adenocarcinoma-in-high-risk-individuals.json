Pancreatic cancer screening procedures include Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, questionnaires, clinic visits, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or Magnetic Resonance (MRI)/Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and collection of blood, stool, and saliva samples.\n\nParticipation in this research study will be a minimum of 30 months and up to 20 years via review of medical records and the annual collection of blood and stool samples.\n\nIt is expected that about 5,000 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis study is supported by the Hale Family Research Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute."
