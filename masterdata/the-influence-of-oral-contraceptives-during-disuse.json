            "briefSummary": "Studies across various sports and physical activities have consistently shown that females incur more injuries compared to their male counterparts, but the underlying reasons for this disparity remain poorly understood. While differences in hormone levels between males and females have been speculated to play a role, very little rigorous research has been conducted to directly examine potential connections between sex hormones and injury risk. Specifically, females have been shown to be at greater risk for hand and wrist injuries. The higher injury incidence begins at puberty and persists across the lifespan, suggesting a link to hormonal factors. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the relationships between the menstrual cycle, exogenous hormones from birth control, and risk factors for sports-related injury in females. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in muscle strength and neuromuscular activation among females using monophasic oral contraceptives, females not using oral contraceptives, and males during one week of wrist/hand immobilization."
