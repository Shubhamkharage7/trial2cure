            "briefSummary": "The goal of this phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the usefulness of an imaging test (zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab \\[89Zr panitumumab\\]) with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing the spread of disease from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastasis) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Traditional PET/CT has a low positive predictive value for diagnosing metastatic disease in head and neck cancer. 89Zr panitumumab is an investigational imaging agent that contains radiolabeled anti-EGFR antibody which is overexpressed in head and neck cancer. The main question this study aims to answer is the sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr panitumumab for the detection of indeterminate metastatic lesions in head and neck cancer.\n\nParticipants will receive 89Zr panitumumab infusion and undergo 89Zr panitumumab PET/CT 1 to 5 days after infusion. Participants will otherwise receive standard of care evaluation and treatment for their indeterminate lesions.\n\nResearchers will compare the 89Zr panitumumab to standard of care imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT, and/or PET/CT).",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Determine the sensitivity and specificity of zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab (89Zrpanitumumab) for the detection of indeterminate metastatic lesions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Compare sensitivity and specificity of standard of care imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\], CT and/or fludeoxyglucose F-18 \\[18F\\]-PET/CT) to 89Zr-panitumumab-PET/CT for detection of indeterminate metastatic lesions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\n- Determine rate of intervention (e.g., biopsy or other invasive procedures) versus (vs) non-intervention (e.g., serial imaging, observation) by treatment team in subjects with indeterminate metastatic lesions on standard of care imaging.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV), 89Zr panitumumab IV, and undergo PET/CT on study."
