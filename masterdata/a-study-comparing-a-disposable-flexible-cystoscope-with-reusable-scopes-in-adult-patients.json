The study will evaluate the user experience and product performance during cystoscopic procedures. Participant experience, tolerance to the procedure, and any differences in adverse events between disposable and reusable scope will be evaluated. The hypothesis is that the RedPine cystoscope will perform as well as reusable scopes and will have a shorter cumulative procedure time."
