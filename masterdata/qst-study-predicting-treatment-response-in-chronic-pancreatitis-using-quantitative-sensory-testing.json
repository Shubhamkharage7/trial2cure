            "briefSummary": "Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) is a novel investigative technique used in other pain conditions to evaluate patterns of chronic pain, and in this study will be used to elucidate pain patterns in patients with Chronic Pancreatitis (CP). QST uses a specific series of standardized stimulations to map the pain system. QST has the potential to change and improve the treatment paradigm for patients with CP and may eventually be able to predict response to invasive CP therapies.",
            "detailedDescription": "In Chronic Pancreatitis (CP), clinical pain symptoms correlate poorly with pancreatic ductal morphology, response to endoscopic or surgical therapy is unpredictable, and the rationale for invasive therapies is often questioned. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a technique used to map the pain system based on the rationale that different neural pathways and networks can be explored using standardized stimulation and simultaneous recording of the evoked pain response by psychophysical and/or objective methods. In this study, the investigators aim to distinguish phenotypes characterized by segmental sensitization of the pancreatic viscerotome, and systemic sensitization with pathological central pain processing.\n\nThe investigators will perform QST on controls and CP subjects consisting of stimulation in several different dermatomes including pancreatic and control areas. All subjects will also answer standardized questionnaires assessing pain, depression, anxiety, and quality of life at baseline. Subjects undergoing endoscopic or surgical therapy will also undergo follow-up testing consisting of the same tests at 1, 3, and 6 months post-procedure for evaluation of changes in their pain profile."
