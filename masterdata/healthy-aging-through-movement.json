Speed will be manipulated to achieve desired intensity and to sustain heart rate in the target zone. Heart rate will be monitored and recorded via telemetry during the on-site exercise sessions. Step cadence (i.e., steps/minute) will also be monitored and recorded during the on-site sessions and discussed with participants as a way to understand and track their speed when completing off-site walking sessions on their own.",
