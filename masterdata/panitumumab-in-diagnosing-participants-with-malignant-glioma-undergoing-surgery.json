Panitumumab-IRDye800 can attach to tumor cells and make them more visible using a special camera during surgery, which may help surgeons better distinguish tumor cells from normal brain tissue and identify small tumors that cannot be seen using current imaging methods.",

Determine/verify the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of panitumumab conjugated to the optical dye IRDye800CW (panitumumab-IRDye800), as an imaging agent in patients undergoing surgery for malignant glioma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 in identifying malignant glioma compared to surrounding normal central nervous system tissue.\n\nII. Determine whether a loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective tumor-to-background ratio.\n\nIII. Determine the optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize the tumor-to-background ratio.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase II study."
