            "briefSummary": "Some kidney transplant candidates have a very low chance of getting a kidney transplant because their immune systems are \"highly sensitized\" to most kidney donors. Being \"highly sensitized\" means that they will likely have to wait a long time (more than 5 years) before an acceptable donor is found for them or, they never receive a compatible donor, and die while on the kidney transplant waitlist.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find out whether two drugs, carfilzomib (Kyprolis\u00ae),and belatacept (Nulojix\u00ae), can make these kidney transplant candidates less sensitized, and make it easier and quicker to find a kidney donor for them.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will enroll 15 eligible participants, 18 to 65 years of age, with end stage renal failure on dialysis who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor transplant with calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRA) \u226599.9% or \\>98% (with \\>5 years of waiting time) or, those with cPRA \\>98% and an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-incompatible approved living donor who have not received a transplant after 1 year in a paired kidney exchange program. The study will evaluate whether the study treatment is safe and can lower the participant's immune system's sensitization to kidney donors, making it easier to find a well-matched kidney for them.\n\nParticipants in the study will be enrolled in two consecutive Cohorts of 5 and 10 patients respectively. The total duration of participation in the study will be 76 weeks for Cohort 1 and 68 weeks for Cohort 2. Participants who undergo kidney transplantation while enrolled in the study will have 52 weeks of follow up post-transplant.\n\nThe duration of participation for living donors is one study visit. Their participation in the study ends upon completion of this study visit."
