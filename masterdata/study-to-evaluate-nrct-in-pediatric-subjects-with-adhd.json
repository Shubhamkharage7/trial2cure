An open label extension (OLE) of 6 weeks will be optional.\n\nSelected sites will collect blood samples for PK from a subset of subjects.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) Math Tests and the key secondary endpoint is ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). The primary analysis will be on effects of 6-week treatment of NRCT-101SR versus placebo on performance (PERMP) in subjects with ADHD."

Currently living in an institutional facility.\n20. Severe physical disability not associated with cognitive function that limits ability to complete testing.\n21.
