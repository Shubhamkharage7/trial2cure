Furthermore, BHB levels in identified brain regions will be compared against measures of craving.\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to investigate if GABA levels will be elevated in key brain regions relative to the baseline scan in AC subjects due to preferential BHB metabolism. The goal is to acquire preliminary data to apply for an R01 or equivalent grant submission to pursue this metabolic therapy in greater detail using the state-of-the-art MRSI platform at Yale University to study alcohol use disorders."
