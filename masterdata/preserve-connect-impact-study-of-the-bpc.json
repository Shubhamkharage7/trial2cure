The specific research questions that will be answered as are as follows:\n\nQuestion 1: Does the BPC improve Child Safety? Hypothesis 1a: Parents who complete the BPC will have fewer substantiated of child maltreatment as per administrative records.\n\nHypothesis 1b: Parents who complete the BPC will report less psychologically aggressive and abusive parenting behaviors (Parenting Scale).\n\nQuestion 2: Does the BPC improve Child Permanency? Hypothesis 2a: Parents who complete the BPC will have fewer out of family placements and placement disruptions as per administrative records.\n\nHypothesis 2b: Parents who complete the BPC will have stability or permanency with their family of origin as per administrative records.\n\nQuestion 3: Does the BPC improve Child Well-Being? Hypothesis 3: Parents who complete the BPC will report improved behavioral and emotional functioning of their children (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire).\n\nQuestion 4: Does the BPC improve Adult Well-Being? Hypothesis 4a: Parents who complete the BPC will report improved use of parenting practices to improve the functional relationship with their children (Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale; Parent Stress Index, Parent-Child Relationship Scales).\n\nHypothesis 4b: Parents who complete the BPC will report improved understanding of the influence of trauma on their parenting behaviors and wellness (Trauma-Informed Knowledge and Parenting Skills Survey).\n\nQuestion 5: Are the improvements of the BPC associated with demographic factors? Exploratory Analysis 5a: Examine the association between measures of child safety, child well-being, child permanency, and adult well-being and measures of acculturation.\n\nExploratory Analysis 5a: Examine the association between measures of child safety, child well-being, child permanency, and adult well-being and measures of acculturation"

The course provides information about the impact of trauma on the development, attachment, emotions and behaviors of children while holding space for parents to learn together about concrete strategies for managing daily and ongoing challenges and enhancing their relationships with their children.
