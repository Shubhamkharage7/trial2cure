            "detailedDescription": "The human studies component of this Focused Program includes clinical phenotyping, neurophysiology, molecular and genetic biomarker discovery, brain imaging, and a clinical trial.These data will be utilized to characterize post-traumatic headache and build univariate and multivariate predictive models for post-traumatic headache persistence and for the response to post-traumatic headache treatment. These studies are described in more detail within a separate clinicaltrials.gov record.\n\nThe clinical trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled investigation of erenumab for the treatment of post-traumatic headache. Participants will be randomized when PTH has been present for 35-56 days. Follow-up questionnaires, headache diary data, pain threshold results, and brain imaging data will be collected longitudinally during the clinical trial to assess for changes over time and associations of such changes with post-traumatic headache treatment outcomes."
