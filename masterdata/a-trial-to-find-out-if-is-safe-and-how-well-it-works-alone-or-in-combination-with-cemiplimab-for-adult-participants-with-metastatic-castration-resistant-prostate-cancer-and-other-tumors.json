The goal of Part 1 (dose escalation) is to determine a safe dose(s) of REGN5678 when it is given alone or in combination with cemiplimab. The goal of Part 2 (dose expansion) is to use the REGN5678 drug dose(s) found in Part 1 to see how well REGN5678 alone or in combination with cemiplimab works to shrink tumors.\n\nThis study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n1. Side effects that may be experienced by taking REGN5678 alone or in combination with cemiplimab\n2. How REGN5678 alone or in combination with cemiplimab works in the body\n3. How much REGN5678 and/or cemiplimab are present in the blood\n4. To see if REGN5678 alone or in combination with cemiplimab works to reduce the size of the tumor by helping the immune system destroy the tumor"
