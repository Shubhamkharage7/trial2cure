Executive function is a set of mental processes that people use every day to make decisions - such as what kinds of foods they choose to eat and when and where they eat those foods.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether executive function (EF) training concurrently improves attitudes, perceptions, and consumption of nutrient-dense foods (i.e., fruits, vegetables) while worsening the same of nutrient-poor foods. In effect, the aim is to test whether EF training can promote the substitution of nutrient-poor foods with fruits and vegetables (FV), as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends regular consumption of FV as part of a healthy dietary pattern. Given the health benefits associated with consuming FV, EF training that effectively promotes increased FV intake may benefit health. For example, FV consumption is associated with the reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and eye and skin health. Moreover, FV consumption is associated with better mental and cognitive health."
