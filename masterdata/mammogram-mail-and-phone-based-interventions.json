The evaluation will compare among the following forms of outreach to help determine whether (a) live calls are more effective at increasing mammogram screening than other forms of outreach and (b) each form of outreach is more effective than no outreach: (1) a postcard, (2) a letter, (3) an auto-dialer phone message, and (4) a live call from a care gaps team. The interventions will be rolled out over many months, allowing for comparisons of effectiveness against those who have not yet been contacted."
