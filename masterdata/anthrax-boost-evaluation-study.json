            "detailedDescription": "This trial is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter study designed to evaluate safety and immune response kinetics of full and half doses of AV7909 administered on 2 primary series vaccination schedules followed by 6- and 12-month boosters. Healthy adult male and female subjects aged 18 through 65 years, inclusive, will be screened for baseline health status to ensure trial eligibility. Subjects meeting all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either half or full doses of AV7909 on 1 of 2 vaccination schedules. Randomization will be stratified by sex. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 within stratum across 4 treatment groups (approximately 55 subjects per group). Subjects will receive a total of 5 intramuscular (IM) injections. Primary series IP doses will be administered on Days 1, 15, and 29, and booster IP doses will be administered on Days 181 and 366. On each IP administration day, each subject will receive an IM injection of full-dose AV7909 (0.5 mL), half-dose AV7909 (0.25 mL), or placebo (0.5 mL or 0.25 mL sodium chloride for injection), based on their assigned treatment group.\n\nUpdate: The 2 treatment groups (Study Groups 1 and 2) in which subjects are to receive full doses of AV7909 were closed to enrollment on 13 May 2024 to preserve resources for the groups that BARDA considers the highest priority and reflects no concerns due to a safety signal or request of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Subjects randomized prior to this date will continue in the study in their assigned treatment group as described in the protocol. Subjects randomized on or after 13 May 2024 will be randomized 1:1 within stratum across the 2 remaining treatment groups (Study Groups 3 and 4), and on each IP administration day will receive an IM injection of half-dose AV7909 (0.25 mL) or placebo (0.25 mL sodium chloride for injection), based on their assigned treatment group. There are no other changes to the study protocol.\n\nSafety assessments will be based on solicited adverse events (AEs; local and systemic reactogenicity symptoms) with onset within 7 days after each IP administration; unsolicited treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with onset within 30 days after each IP administration; and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs), and medically attended adverse events (MAAEs) occurring during study participation (ie, up to 1 year after the last IP administration). For this study, a PIMMC is considered to be unexpected and will be treated as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR) per 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nImmunogenicity assessments will include geometric mean titer (GMT), seroprotection rate, and seroconversion rate by toxin-neutralizing antibody (TNA) 50% neutralization factor (NF50) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) anti-protective antigen (PA) Immunoglobulin G (IgG)."
