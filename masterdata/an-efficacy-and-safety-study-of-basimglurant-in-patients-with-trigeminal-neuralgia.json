            "detailedDescription": "This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of basimglurant in patients with TN. Basimglurant is a potent inhibitor of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) which controls a wide range of processes in both central and peripheral nervous system. Inhibition of the mGluR5 receptor has shown therapeutic potential for pain associated with conditions such as TN. The drug has been shown to have a favorable safety profile in adults, children and adolescents. The aim of the study is to determine whether Basimglurant decreases both duration and intensity of facial pain associated with TN by use of a patient pain diary and the Patient-reported Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) compared to baseline."
