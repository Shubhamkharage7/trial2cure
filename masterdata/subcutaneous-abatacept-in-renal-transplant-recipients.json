            "briefSummary": "After a kidney transplant, patients take drugs called anti-rejection drugs (immunosuppressives) to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new kidney. At present it is not possible to have a successful transplant without these drugs. These drugs make it possible for a person who receives the transplant to accept the \"foreign\" kidney. Most patients who get a transplant need to take anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the kidney continues to work.\n\nResearchers are looking to learn whether abatacept is as good as belatacept in preventing rejection, whether there are other benefits or harms associated with abatacept treatment, and possibly allows greater flexibility on patient's travel and time since abatacept is self-administered at home.\n\nThis study is being done to answer these questions:\n\nAre weekly abatacept injections under the skin a safe and effective substitute for monthly belatacept intravenous (IV) infusions? and How well does the kidney function after switching from belatacept to abatacept?",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I, open-label, prospective, single-arm single-center study to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of a regimen substituting subcutaneous abatacept early post-transplant in place of intravenous belatacept as an immunosuppressant in first-time renal transplant recipients.\n\nThere is a single arm in this study; the Investigational (abatacept) group. Participants will be assigned to a treatment regimen between 2 and 5 months after transplantation. The study drug will be administered until month 12 post-transplant; at that point, all participants will be transitioned to a physician-directed immunosuppressive regimen post-study."
