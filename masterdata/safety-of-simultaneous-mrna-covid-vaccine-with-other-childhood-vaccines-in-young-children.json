(This may result in a temporary delay of vaccination).\n* Receipt of an antipyretic medication (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) within 72 hours prior to enrollment (this may result in a temporary delay of vaccination) or planned receipt of a prophylactic antipyretic medication on the day of and/or days following vaccination prior to any measured increase in temperature in anticipation of a fever (this exclusion does not apply if the Parent/LAR indicates they might administer antipyretics or analgesics after vaccination to reduce a fever or pain).\n* Immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy since birth.\n* Long term (at least 14 days of prednisone 2 mg/kg/day or equivalent other glucocorticoid) use of any parenteral steroids or high-dose inhaled steroids (\\>800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the 6 months prior to enrollment (topical and nasal steroids are allowed).\n* Has an active case of COVID-19 infection.\n* History of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\n* History of myocarditis or pericarditis.\n* Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the participant at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the participant unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.\n* Any child or grandchild of a study investigator or study team member.",
