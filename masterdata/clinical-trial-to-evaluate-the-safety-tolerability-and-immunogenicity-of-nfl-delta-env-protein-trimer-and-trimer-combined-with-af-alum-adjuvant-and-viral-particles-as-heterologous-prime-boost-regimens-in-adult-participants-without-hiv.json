Enrollment of individuals with BMI \u2265 40, whom the site investigator assesses are in good health, may be considered by PSRT on a case-by-case basis.\n* Diabetes mellitus (DM). Type 2 DM controlled with diet alone (and confirmed by HgbA1c \u2264 8% within the last 6 months) or a history of isolated gestational diabetes are not exclusionary. Enrollment of individuals with Type 2 DM that is well controlled on hypoglycemic agent(s) may be considered by the PSRT on a case-by-case basis, provided that the HgbA1c is \u2264 8% within the last 6 months (sites may draw these at screening).\n* Previous or current recipient of an investigational HIV vaccine (previous placebo recipients are not excluded).\n* Receipt of non-HIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 1 year. Exceptions include vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA or World Health Organization (WHO) emergency use listing (EUL).\n* Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including systemic medication (includes oral, intramuscular, or intravenously administrated medications) use likely to impair immune response to vaccine in the opinion of the site investigator, such as systemic glucocorticoid use equal to or greater than prednisone 10 mg/day within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n* Blood products or immunoglobulin within 16 weeks prior to enrollment; receipt of immunoglobulin within 16 weeks prior to enrollment requires PSRT approval.\n* Receipt of any live, attenuated, replicating vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or planned administration within 4 weeks after enrollment.
