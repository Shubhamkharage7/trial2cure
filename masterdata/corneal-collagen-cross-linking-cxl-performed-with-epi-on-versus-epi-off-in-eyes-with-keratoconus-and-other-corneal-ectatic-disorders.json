Presence of Intacs or corneal rings or segments in the study eye.\n7. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye(s) to be treated that may predispose the eye for future complications or prevent the possibility of improved vision, for example:\n\n   1. History of corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster keratitis, recurrent erosion syndrome, corneal melt, or corneal dystrophy, etc.)\n   2.

If female, pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy, or having a positive urine pregnancy test prior to the randomization of, or treatment of, either eye during the course of the study.\n13. A condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with or prolong epithelial healing, including a history of chemical injury or delayed epithelial healing in the study eye.\n14.
