Quality of life, however, remains poor for many patients and the probability of distant recurrence is high. In this study, we will attempt to reduce the distant recurrence rate and improve quality of life by making changes in the timing and administration of chemotherapy and radiation and doing less invasive rectal surgery when indicated.",
            "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the study is to determine if neo-adjuvant FOLFOX therapy and lengthening the time interval between neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and transanal local excision will increase the percentage of patients with pathologic complete remission.\n\nThis is a prospective pilot study to examine the impact of two variables: 1) addition of neo-adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy, and 2) increasing the time interval between completion of chemo-radiotherapy and subsequent surgery, on the rate of achieving pathologic complete remission with avoidance of radical resection while maintaining an excellent local control with improvement of quality of life.\n\nAll procedures in this study are standard of care, the study question relates to the use of neo-adjuvant FOLFOX and the timing between the end of radiation and surgery."
