The rate of fusion success and adverse events will be compared retrospectively to patients who underwent instrumented ACDF utilizing structural allograft bone with plates.",

These subjects will be retrospectively reviewed for radiographic outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, as well as adverse events and sensory and motor outcomes. If available, NDI and VAS questionnaires completed during baseline and post-op visits will be collected. Prospective subjects will consist of 20 patients who are receiving Tritanium C as standard of care. These subjects will be asked to complete NDI and VAS questionnaires at baseline and post-op visits. Radiographic outcomes, adverse events, sensory and motor neurological outcomes, as determined per standard of care will be collected at those same time points. The total number of subjects is N=40."
