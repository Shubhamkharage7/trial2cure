All participants will complete assessments at baseline and at 18 weeks post randomization.\n\nDepending on the group assignment the PST program will be delivered by Lumen, a virtual voice-based coach on a study iPad, or by a human coach in person for the first session and then via videoconference or phone for the remaining 7 sessions. Participants assigned to the waitlist control group can receive the Lumen coached PST on a study iPad after completing their 18-week follow-up assessment.\n\nParticipants will receive 8 coaching sessions to learn problem-solving skills and work on unresolved problems in daily living that may be interfering with their emotional well-being and contributing to depression and anxiety symptoms.",
            "detailedDescription": "All participants will complete measurements of neural target engagement and treatment outcomes at both baseline (0 week) and 18 weeks.\n\nStudy Visit 1: This will include (1) Physical measurements such as height, weight, and blood pressure, (2) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, (3) surveys of intervention-related measures, and (4) surveys of patient-reported outcomes, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms, social functioning, and health-related quality of life.\n\nFollowing the successful completion of Visit 1 and all the surveys, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to 1 of 3 study groups, as described below.\n\nProblem Solving Treatment (PST) Groups\n\nGroup 1: Lumen Coached Group :\n\nParticipants assigned to this group will attend an Intervention Orientation session to receive the Coach Lumen tutorial, a study iPad, and a Lumen Intervention Workbook. They will complete 8 PST sessions (4 weekly and then 4 biweekly) with Coach Lumen at home over 12 weeks.\n\nGroup 2: Human Coached Group Participants assigned to this group will receive a study iPad and Human-Coached Intervention Workbook, and will complete 8 PST sessions (4 weekly and then 4 biweekly) with a trained health coach over 12 weeks. They will complete the first session in person and then the remaining sessions via videoconference or phone.\n\nGroup 3: Optional (Delayed) Lumen Coached Group Participants assigned to this group may choose to attend a Lumen Orientation session to receive training and a study iPad to complete 8 PST sessions with Coach Lumen after completing their follow-up assessment at 18 weeks.\n\nRegardless of the group assignment, participants will complete brief Nightly Mood Check-in surveys about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences over the day, for 7 nights, approximately every other week over 18 weeks (i.e., a total of 58 nights). These check-ins are sent via text message to their mobile phone.\n\nStudy Visit 2:\n\nRegardless of group assignment, participants will be asked to attend a second in-person visit for data collection at 18 weeks. Like Visit 1, Visit 2 will include physical measurements, a brain scan (after a negative pregnancy urine test, if applicable), and online surveys (if not yet completed before the visit), and will last approximately 90 minutes."
