At the time of identification of eligibility for participation, patients will be randomized to one of three arms (1:1:1 ratio): Arm 1 consists of patients randomized to conventional cardiac rehab only, Arm 2 consists of patients randomized to conventional cardiac rehab with the addition of the mHealth platform, and Arm 3 consists of patients randomized to remote case management using the mHealth platform only. Clinical metrics will include traditional cardiovascular risk factors with additional tracking of service utilization and adherence, and quality of life. Measures will be made at baseline (pre-intervention) and \\~3-months (coinciding with completion of conventional CR). Additional follow-up will occur at 12 months post CR entry. Randomization to study arms will be done with a multidimensional dynamic allocation algorithm, minimizing imbalances in age, sex, body mass index, and race across study arms."
