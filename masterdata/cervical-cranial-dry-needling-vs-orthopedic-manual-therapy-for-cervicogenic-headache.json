            "briefSummary": "Dry needling is a therapeutic modality used to treat a number of neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Practice trends suggest it is becoming widely used by Physical Therapists to help patients manage symptoms associated with CGH, however, there is limited scientific evidence demonstrating meaningful impact for dry needling for CGH. Manual therapy (thrust and non-thrust mobilizations) to the cervical spine are well researched and have an established treatment effect for managing symptoms related to CGH. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months) for patients with CGH treated with cervical-cranial dry needling or pragmatically applied orthopedic manual therapy to the cervical spine. In addition to either the cervical-cranial dry needling or manual therapy to the cervical spine, patients will also receive patient education, thoracic manipulation, and exercise.",
            "detailedDescription": "The use of dry needling is becoming widely used by Physical Therapists in the United States for a number of neuromusculoskeletal conditions including cervicogenic headache (CGH). Dry needling is performed by taking a mono-filament needle and inserting it into symptomatic soft tissue. In this trial, the dry needling will be performed segmentally in the neck and along the patient's headache distribution pattern. Orthopedic manual therapy (OMT) may include both thrust and non-thrust techniques applied to a targeted spinal level and has a well-established treatment effect for patients with CGH. In this trial, the OMT will be applied pragmatically to the cervical spine at the most symptomatic level of the headache. Other interventions used in this trial will include patient education, thoracic manipulation and exercise.\n\nPatients will be randomized to receive either dry needling or OMT 2x/week for 2 weeks and then 1-2x/week for 2 weeks totaling 6-8 visits over the course of 1 month. The 1 week and 1 month outcomes collected will be reported on separately from the 3 and 12 months."
