            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial evaluates how well transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) works for treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. TACE is a minimally invasive procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy directly into an artery that supplies blood to tumors, and then blocking off the blood supply to the tumors. Mitomycin (chemotherapy), Lipiodol (drug carrier), and Embospheres (small plastic beads that block off the artery) are injected into the tumor-feeding artery. This traps the chemotherapy inside the tumor and also cuts off the tumor's blood supply. As a result, the tumor is exposed to a high dose of chemotherapy, and is also deprived of nutrients and oxygen. TACE can be effective at controlling or stopping the growth of lung tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine safety and efficacy (local progression free survival) of chemoembolization of lung cancer that is chemorefractory, unresectable, and unablatable.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive lung chemoembolization using Lipiodol, mitomycin, and Embospheres. Response to treatment is evaluated on computed tomography (CT) scans."
