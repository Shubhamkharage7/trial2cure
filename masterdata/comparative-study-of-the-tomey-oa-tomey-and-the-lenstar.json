A complete complement of acceptable scans can be defined as subjects having 3 acceptable replicate scans on each of the 3 devices, at each of the 3 configurations. This is also synonymous with 3 scans for each of the 3 configurations on all 3 devices. If subjects have more than 3 acceptable scans per configuration on a device, only the first 3 will be considered for analyses.\n\nThe agreement analysis will be conducted utilizing the first set of acceptable scans from each instrument for all overlapping measurement types (for all measurement types two or more of the devices have in common) related to performance endpoints."
