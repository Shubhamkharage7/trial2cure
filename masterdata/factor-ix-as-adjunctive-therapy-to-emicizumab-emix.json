The investigators will compare the hemostatic effect of added FIX to the effect of added bypassing agents (activated prothrombin complex aPCC, and recombinant VIIa rVIIA, recombinant porcine FVIII)\n\nPlasma will be collected from patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors treated with Emicizumab, a group of plasma samples will be spiked with different concentrations of Factor IX. Thrombin generation profiles will be obtained using CAT.\n\nAnother group of plasma samples will be spiked with different concentrations of by passing agents (activated prothrombin complex aPCC, and recombinant VIIa rVIIA, recombinant porcine FVIII). Thrombin generation profiles will be obtained using CAT."
