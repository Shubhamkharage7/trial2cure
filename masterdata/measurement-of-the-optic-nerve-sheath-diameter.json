Patients will be identified on the Emergency Medicine Department tracking board. Patients, once identified as meeting inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in this study and full written consent will be required. All participants will have identical procedures and there will be no groups."

Study staff will discuss the study with the patient and obtain consent. At that point, operator will perform ocular ultrasound. Procedure will start with either the linear or microconvex probe. A single-use sterile gel packet will be used to apply gel to one closed eyelid. The probe will be placed with minimal pressure on the eye. A transverse measurement of the ONSD will be taken. In this same view the maximal transverse diameter of the eyeball will also be measured. Images of the eye with ONSD and ETD measurements will be captured. Repeat until three measurements have been obtained resulting in an average ONSD and ETD for that eye. Repeat for other eye. Switch probe and repeat on both eyes.",
