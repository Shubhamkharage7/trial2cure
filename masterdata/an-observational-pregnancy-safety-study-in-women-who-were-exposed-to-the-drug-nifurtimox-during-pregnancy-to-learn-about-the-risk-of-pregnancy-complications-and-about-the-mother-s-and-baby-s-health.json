            "briefSummary": "This is an observational study in which data from women with Chagas disease who will take or have already taken nifurtimox during pregnancy and the impact on their babies are studied.\n\nChagas disease is an inflammatory, infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is mainly spread by insects called triatomine bug. If Chagas disease is left untreated, it can later cause e.g. serious heart and digestive problems.\n\nNifurtimox has been used for more than 50 years to treat Chagas disease in children and adults.\n\nIt is not recommended to be used during pregnancy as data from animal studies indicate that it may harm the baby. Currently, there are not enough data to know if this is also the case in humans.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to collect data on the safety of nifurtimox use in pregnant women. To do this, researchers will collect the following information:\n\n* Birth defects (abnormal and problematic structures or functions, a child is born with)\n* Pregnancy outcomes (like live birth, preterm birth, still birth/death of the unborn baby, miscarriage, or abortion)\n* Certain health problems of the child up to 12 months of age\n* Certain health problems of the women experienced during pregnancy The data will be collected from different sources including telephone calls with the women or their doctor, CRFs (case reprt forms) or from medical records The researchers will compare the proportion of children with birth defects, pregnancy outcomes or certain health problems of the child or the women during pregnancy with available data on these outcomes in the general population.\n\nThe study will run for approximately 10 years."
