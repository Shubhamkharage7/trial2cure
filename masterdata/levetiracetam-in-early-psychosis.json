Levetiracetam (Keppra) is a medication approved for the treatment of epilepsy; it reduces excessive activity in the brain. This study will test the hypotheses that adding levetiracetam will improve psychotic symptoms that are unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment and will protect the brain from atrophy (volume loss). .",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants will complete screening and baseline visits before being randomized in a 2:1 ratio to levetiracetam or placebo added to the antipsychotic medication. They will complete weekly study visits for the first 4 weeks (Baseline, Weeks 2-4) and then additional visits at Week 6, 8, and 12. Participants will be studied both by assessing change in symptom severity and cognitive performance over the 12 weeks as well as using an imaging measure of hippocampal volume integrity at baseline and week 12. After completing Week 12 or decision to withdraw prematurely from the study, participants will complete a 9 day medication tapering regimen."
