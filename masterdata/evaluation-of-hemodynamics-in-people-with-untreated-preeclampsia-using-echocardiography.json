            "detailedDescription": "This study seeks to evaluate cardiac output in people with untreated preeclampsia in a tertiary referral centre in the US. In doing so the investigators hope to better understand the underpinning of the pathophysiology of this condition and provide evidence for (or against) the new theory of the development of preeclampsia. The investigators also seek to examine CO changes at birth during cesarean delivery (CD) comparing healthy pregnant people with people with preeclampsia and further understand the changes in cardiac output (CO) after treatment with antihypertensive agents for preeclamptic patients so that the investigators may better rationale treatment with these agents and evaluate the changes that may occur at the time of CD and after cesarean birth in people with preeclampsia using TTE so that fluid therapy and blood pressure treatment can be prescribed based on hemodynamic findings. Further the investigators aim to imbed echocardiography into the management of people with preeclampsia and to determine the feasibility and long-term sustainability of conducting echocardiography studies in pregnant people with a multidisciplinary group at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Boston."
