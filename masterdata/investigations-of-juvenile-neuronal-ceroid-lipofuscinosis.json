            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nCLN3, or Batten disease, is a genetic disorder. This deadly disease leads to decline of brain and nervous system functions. Symptoms of CLN3 typically occur between 4 and 7 years of age. They include changes in how a person sees, thinks, and moves. CLN3 can also cause seizures. No effective treatments for the disease are yet known. There is limited testing of potential therapies. Researchers want to study CLN3 more so they can improve future therapies.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo identify clinical or biochemical markers that can be used as therapeutic outcome measures for CLN3.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople with CLN3. It must be based on\n\nTwo CLN3 mutations OR\n\nOne CLN3 mutation AND findings seen with a powerful microscope\n\nFamily members of a person with CLN3.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have already been referred to NIH for CLN3 evaluation.\n\nIf participants agree to do the study, they will:\n\n1. give spinal fluid, blood, urine, and skin samples. They may provide other samples if they were already collected. These may include cells, surgical specimens, and DNA.\n2. will be seen by multiple healthcare specialists.\n\nParticipants may provide medical records or photos. Participants will sign a release of medical records form.P\n\nResearchers may send samples or clinical data to other investigators. For research testing, the samples will not include the participant s name. For a test in a clinical lab, researchers will include the participant s name. These results will become part of the clinical record at NIH.",
            "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to obtain both baseline and rate of progression data on clinical and biochemical markers that may later be used as an outcome measure in a clinical trial, and to establish a biorepository of samples from CLN3 participants. For comparisons, focused clinical data and relevant evaluations and biospecimens will also be collected from individuals with Neuronal Ceroids Lipofuscinosis (NCL) of other types and from family members of all affected individuals.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n1. Identify clinical or biochemical markers that can be used as therapeutic outcome measures for CLN3.\n2. Evaluate clinical aspects of CLN3 to provide tools for future therapeutic trials.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nEstablish a biorepository of samples from well-characterized individuals with CLN3, and family members of CLN3 individuals, for future research related to CLN3.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\n1. Blood, urine, or CSF biomarkers.\n2. Proportion of participants who achieve a clinically valid and interpretable score on administered measures.\n3. Scores obtained for each administered measure.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nTolerability and feasibility of each measure of the clinical battery of assessments based on clinician observation."
