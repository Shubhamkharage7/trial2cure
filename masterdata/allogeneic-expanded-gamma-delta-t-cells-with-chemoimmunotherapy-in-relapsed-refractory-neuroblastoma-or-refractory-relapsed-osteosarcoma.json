            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of allogeneic expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells when delivered with Dinutuximab, temozolomide, irinotecan, and zoledronate in children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma or refractory/ relapsed osteosarcoma as well as to define the toxicities of allogeneic expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells when delivered with Dinutuximab, temozolomide, irinotecan, and zoledronate",
            "detailedDescription": "High-risk neuroblastoma and metastatic osteosarcoma are aggressive and lethal pediatric solid tumors. Survival remains less than 50% and those patients who do survive suffer many treatment-related acute and chronic toxicities, stressing a critical need for novel tumor-targeting therapies.\n\n\u03b3\u03b4 T cells are an innovative approach to cell therapy for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma as they are MHC-independent and directly cytolytic to tumor cells. The team has developed a GMP-compliant manufacturing strategy to expand \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from normal donor and neuroblastoma patient apheresis products for this trial.\n\nThis is a Phase 1 study to determine the safety, recommended Phase 2 cell therapy dose, and preliminary efficacy of allogenic (third party) ex vivo expanded gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells in combination with dinutuximab, temozolomide, irinotecan, and zoledronate in children with refractory, relapsed, or progressive neuroblastoma or osteosarcoma.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to help doctors and scientists learn if \u03b3\u03b4 T cells will aid in clinical and disease response in this population and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\n\nThird-party \u03b3\u03b4 T cells will be prepared from healthy donors and expanded under GMP conditions at Expression Therapeutics, LLC. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells will be expanded, cryopreserved as numerous aliquots, and transported to The Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston Campus. At the appropriate time, an aliquot of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells appropriate for the size of the subject will be thawed and infused into the patient according to institutional protocol.\n\nSubjects will receive a single infusion of third-party, ex vivo expanded, frozen then thawed \u03b3\u03b4 T cell product on Day 6, and then if they meet the criteria for subsequent \u03b3\u03b4 T cell dose will receive a second dose on Day 13. The \u03b3\u03b4 T cell dose will be infused after the dinutuximab, temozolomide, irinotecan, and zoledronate schedule is complete. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. The entry dose level is Dose Level 1, with escalation up to Dose Level 3 following standard 3+3 rules for \u03b3\u03b4 T cell dose escalation design.\n\nA minimum of 6 and a maximum of 24 patients with refractory, relapsed, or progressive neuroblastoma or osteosarcoma will be recruited through various strategies, including face-to-face encounters between participants and study staff during clinical encounters at CHOA.\n\nLeftover blood samples collected may be stored for future research by the sponsor of this study. This research will advance scientific knowledge and clinical data in the solid tumor field and knowledge of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Cell therapy has been a promising treatment for solid tumors, so with this advancement in T-cell therapy, the team can potentially advance patient outcomes."
