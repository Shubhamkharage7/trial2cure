            "briefSummary": "Brown fat is a type of fat, found in both children and adults, which can produce heat and regulate the body's metabolism and energy use. White fat is the more common type of fat which is used to store extra calories. Understanding more about differences between brown and white fat may allow us to develop new approaches to improve the body's metabolism.",
            "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of this study, is to map fat (adipose) tissue differences in humans. The investigators will probe multiple aspects of fat cell (adipocyte) identity by integrating quantitative chemical imaging, single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc and snRNAseq), and site-specific collection of adipocytes and adipocyte precursors.\n\nDeidentified data from these studies will be submitted to the Human Cell Atlas. The investigators anticipate that these studies will ultimately increase understanding of mechanisms by which fat (adipose) tissue regulates systemic metabolism (energy transformation in the body), and promotes risk for metabolic disease. Knowledge gained from this research may be used to set the stage for disease-specific analyses, and aid in the development of personalized medicine for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes."
