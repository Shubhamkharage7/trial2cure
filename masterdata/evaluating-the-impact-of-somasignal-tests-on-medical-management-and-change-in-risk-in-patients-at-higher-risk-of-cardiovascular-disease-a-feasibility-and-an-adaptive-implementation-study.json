The first 12 consenting patients will be placed in the planned assessment group for feasibility and will not be randomized. These participants will undergo visits and blood draw collection at 3 months. They will be informed of their SomaSignal Test results at baseline and 3 months.\n\nRecommendations for any medical management changes will be made based on an understanding of those results.\n\nRandomized Study The succeeding 200 participants will be randomized using permuted mixed block randomization, in a 2:1 ratio, i.e., 2 participants to Group 1 (informed of their test results) and 1 participant to Group 2 (uninformed of their test results). At enrollment, and for 6 months thereafter, clinical information will be obtained from each participant's medical records, and/or directly from the participant during procedures, treatments, study-specific visits, and/or follow-up visits. Data collected for the study will have data linkage at SomaLogic, Inc., where data analysis will be done.\n\nAt baseline and 6-months (+30 days) post-enrollment, patients will undergo a patient visit and blood collection. Blood will be collected as a stand-alone sample collection, or when other ordered lab work is done, or from access lines inserted during a usual or specialized care. Samples will be sent to the Intermountain Central laboratory for clinical testing. A sample will also be processed and shipped to SomaLogic, Inc. for analysis at baseline and 6 months.\n\nFor the informed arm, the SomaSignal Test reports will be provided at the time they are available (2 to 4 weeks after the blood draw). Any recommended changes in medical management will be recorded in the case report forms and will be verified by the Principal Investigator.\n\nFor the uninformed arm, the SomaSignal Test results will not be provided to the study team until after the 6-month post-test visit. Adjustments, if any, would be made to the participant's management at that time."
