            "briefSummary": "This randomized control trial study among Pre-exposure prophylactic users (PrEP) aims to learn and determine the efficacy of Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBRIT) in reducing the risk of alcohol use. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. How alcohol use impacts the PrEP continuum and to understand how early intervention and treatment approach affects alcohol use and PrEP adherence.\n2. Investigate the effectiveness of the SBIRT intervention in preventing hazardous alcohol use and its impact on gut dysbiosis in PrEP users.\n3. To determine alterations in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis), intestinal homeostasis, systemic inflammation, and markers of liver disease associated with hazardous alcohol use among PrEP users.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study pursues a randomized control trial (RCT) with persons who use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to determine the efficacy of SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, \\& Referral to Treatment) in reducing the risk of alcohol drinking and associated pathogenic changes in the gut liver axis.\n\nParticipants in this study will attend visits at 3 months, 6 months,s and 12 months for about 60 to 90 minutes. These visits may include filling out a survey, participating in an interview, meeting with an SBIRT interventionist, and providing the aforementioned samples: Blood, urine, stool, saliva, oral and vaginal, if applicable.\n\nThis study will use a syndemic approach to expand the HIV/AIDS prevention toolkit among populations impacted by alcohol with a range of patterns of episodic and long-term use and associated behavioral and biological risks for HIV acquisition.\n\nSpecifically, the team will execute a randomized control trial among Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) users demonstrating heightened alcohol use to test the effectiveness of the Screening, Brief Intervention, \\& Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention to reduce alcohol use and examine the subsequent impact on the gut microbiome compared to individuals receiving treatment as usual and PrEP users not demonstrating elevated alcohol use. Finally, we will employ qualitative methods (in-depth interviews) and analysis to understand decision-making factors influencing PrEP adherence and alcohol use over time."

In addition there are following characteristics:\n\n* It is brief (e.g., typically about 5-10 minutes for brief interventions; about 5 to 12 sessions for brief treatments)\n* The screening is universal.\n* One or more specific behaviors related to risky alcohol and drug use are targeted.\n* The services occur in a public health non-substance abuse treatment setting.\n* It is comprehensive (comprised of screening, brief intervention/treatment, and referral to treatment).\n* Strong research or experiential evidence supports the model's effectiveness.",
