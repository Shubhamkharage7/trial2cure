            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nReplacing a valve in the heart can save many people s lives. The procedure is called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In rare cases, a flap of tissue called a leaflet can shift during TAVR; the leaflet may block blood flow to the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. About 50% of people who experience this problem will die. To reduce this risk, doctors will cut this leaflet during TAVR. But the tools used to cut the leaflet were originally designed for other purposes. Using these tools during TAVR can be complicated and risky. Researchers want to make TAVR safer.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a new device (TELLTALE) designed specifically for use during TAVR.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 21 years and older who are undergoing TAVR and who are at high risk of coronary artery obstruction.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have routine tests that are done before undergoing TAVR.\n\nBefore the procedure, participants will complete a questionnaire. They will talk about how their heart disease affects their quality of life. Their physical abilities and their risk of stroke will be assessed.\n\nParticipants will be admitted to the hospital for TAVR. They will be placed under general anesthesia or moderate sedation. The procedure will be performed using the TELLTALE guidewire system.\n\nParticipants will repeat the tests of their physical abilities after the procedure. They will also repeat the questionnaire about their quality of life. These will be repeated again at a follow-up visit in 30 days.\n\nParticipants will have a final study visit after 90 days. This visit may be in person or remote.",
            "detailedDescription": "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) may cause life threatening coronary artery obstruction, whether implanted in native aortic stenosis or bioprosthetic aortic valve failure.\n\nWe have developed and validated the techniques of BASILICA (Bioprosthetic Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction during transcatheter aortic valve replacement), using bedside modification of off-the-shelf guidewires. These bedside modifications require additional assembly steps and special expertise, and thereby risks procedure failure and complications.\n\nTransmural Systems and NHLBI have developed a purpose-built electrosurgical guidewire system (TELLTALE) to simplify the BASILICA-TAVR procedure. The purpose of this protocol is to test the efficacy and safety of this purpose-built guidewire in the setting of BASILICA-TAVR."
