            "detailedDescription": "Twenty (20) persons treated for cancer of the head and neck (HNCA) with radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy (RT/CRT) at least 5 years previously will be randomized to an 8-week program of either EMST only and Standard Care only in order to examine the impact of EMST on swallowing function. The EMST program will consist of 5 sets of 5 breaths, 5 days per week for 8 weeks at 75% of maximum expiratory strength. Patients randomized to the EMST group will use the EMST150 (product name) expiratory muscle strength trainer according to package instructions. Standard Care will include swallowing exercises designed to strengthen muscles that contribute to pharyngeal phase motor events and increase structural range of motion. Subjects will be instructed to practice these exercises following a progressive protocol 5 days per week for 8 weeks.\n\nAll subjects will be evaluated at baseline and at the completion of their rehabilitation program. Assessment will include measurement of maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) to objectively document swallow function, administration of swallow-related quality of life (QOL) questionnaires, and documentation of current diet using the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) Drink Levels and Food Levels."
