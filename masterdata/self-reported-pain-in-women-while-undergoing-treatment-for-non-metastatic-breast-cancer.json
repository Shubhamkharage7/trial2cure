Participation in this study will not affect your cancer treatment.",

At the end of that week, blood will be drawn from each subject to directly measure the WBC/ANC, which can then be compared to self-reported pain and evaluated for any correlation. Finally, subjects will be divided into two groups by age: 45 years or younger, and over 45 to look for any differences in pain or WBC/ANC measurements based on age."
