Neuropsychological and sleep measures, functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), high density EEG and questionnaires will be performed at 5 timepoints - baseline, post-treatment after first period of 10 daily iTBS rTMS sessions, post-washout period of 4 weeks, post-treatment after cross-over to second period of 10 daily iTBS rTMS sessions, and 4 weeks follow-up post-treatment."
