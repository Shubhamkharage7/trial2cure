            "detailedDescription": "To conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of all virgin penile prosthesis implantations with the goal of assessing Irrisept's candidacy as an alternative to traditional antibiotic irrigation (Rifampin, Gentamicin for all patients, with the addition of Amphotericin B if patient has a history of diabetics) during penile prosthesis surgery. The investigators believe that Irrisept provides adequate antibacterial and antifungal coverage to serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotic therapy. Additionally, the investigators believe a cost analysis would support the use of Irrisept in the event that non-inferiority is demonstrated."
