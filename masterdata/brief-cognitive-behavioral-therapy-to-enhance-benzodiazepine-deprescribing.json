            "detailedDescription": "Nearly 10% of Americans aged 55 years and older fill benzodiazepine (BZD) prescriptions annually. Chronic use of BZD place older adults at an increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, functional decline, preventable hospitalizations, and mortality.\n\nResearch study investigators will conduct a single-arm pilot trial of the intervention in 20 adults aged 55 and older currently taking chronic BZDs. The aim is to evaluate feasibility/acceptability of the refined deprescribing intervention using mixed methods. At intervention end, research study investigators will conduct surveys and qualitative interviews with participants to obtain feedback on participant experience and intervention components (e.g., acceptability, usefulness, relevance, satisfaction) as well as views on future format options. Using these data and the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework, research study investigators will further refine the intervention in preparation for larger scale testing and implementation."
