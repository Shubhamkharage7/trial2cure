            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies whether different imaging techniques can provide additional and more accurate information than the usual approach for assessing the activity of tumors in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The usual approach for this currently is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study is trying to learn more about the meaning of changes in MRI scans after treatment, as while the appearance of some of these changes may reflect progressing tumor, some may be due the treatment. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRIs, along with positron emission tomography (PET) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, may help doctors tell which changes are a reflection of the treatment and which changes may be due to progressing tumor.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. For each biomarker (dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR Imaging, fluciclovine F18 \\[18F-fluciclovine\\] PET, MR spectroscopy), to evaluate whether the biomarker can stratify patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) that have progressive enhancement within 12 weeks post-radiation therapy (XRT) into risk groups based on overall survival.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate whether each biomarker (dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR Imaging, 18F-fluciclovine PET, MR spectroscopy) can predict final determination of pseudo-progression (PsP) versus (vs.) true progression on follow-up MR imaging as evaluated by a semi-automated central reading process and by institutional radiologist readings.\n\nII. To evaluate whether a prediction model that incorporates multiple biomarkers can discriminate patients with progressive enhancement within 12 weeks post-XRT into high and low risk groups for overall survival.\n\nIII. To evaluate whether clinical and imaging biomarkers are predictive of overall and progression-free survival in patients who do not show progressive enhancement within 12 weeks post-XRT.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine how different methods of defining PsP vs. true progression on imaging relate to patient survival.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive a gadolinium-based contrast agent and undergo DSC-MRI scans at 4 and 8 weeks after completion of standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy. Patients with evidence of disease progression then undergo MR spectroscopy or receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET scan within 12 weeks of SOC radiation therapy completion.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up every 8 weeks for 1 year followed by every 12 weeks for 5 years."
