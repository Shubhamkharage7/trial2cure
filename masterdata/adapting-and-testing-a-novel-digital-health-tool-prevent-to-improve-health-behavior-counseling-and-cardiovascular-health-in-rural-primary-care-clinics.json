            "briefSummary": "The focus on this application is low-income, rural patients, since cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence is 40% higher among rural than urban residents. Health behavior counseling and follow-up care are required for patients with an elevated body mass index who have increased risk for CVD. Counseling is most effective when developed with, and tailored to, the patient and offered with resources that support healthy food intake and physical activity. Resource referral and follow-up is particularly important in rural low income residents who often have more severe social needs that impede healthy behaviors. The proposed research will leverage the candidate's digital health tool (PREVENT) for healthcare teams to use within the clinic visit. PREVENT visually displays patient-reported and electronic health record (EHR) data to facilitate counseling and deliver tailored physical activity and healthy food intake goals and resources. PREVENT may improve the quality of required care and promote cardiovascular health equity. This research will: 1) collaborate with rural and clinic partners to modify and integrate the PREVENT tool for low-income, rural patients with obesity (Aim 1); and 2) conduct a pilot pragmatic clinical trial of PREVENT to optimize feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and potential health equity impact."
