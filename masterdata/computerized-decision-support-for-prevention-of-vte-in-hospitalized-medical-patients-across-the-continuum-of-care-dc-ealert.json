            "briefSummary": "Hospitalized medical patients have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) across the continuum of care, including after hospital discharge. In the APEX Trial of hospitalized patients with acute medical illness, extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis with oral betrixaban reduced the frequency of asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic proximal or distal DVT, symptomatic nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE), or VTE-related death compared with short-duration enoxaparin. Obstacles to integration of these data in the hospitalized Medical Service patient population, including failure to identify at-risk patients, educational gaps in strategies for VTE prevention after discharge, and medication nonadherence, can be overcome with alert-based computerized decision support. This study is a single-center, 400-patient, randomized controlled trial of an EPIC Best Practice Advisory (BPA; alert-based computerized decision support tool) to increase prescription of extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis and decrease symptomatic VTE in high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness.\n\nSpecific Aim #1: To determine the impact of electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC Best Practice Advisory \\[BPA\\]) on prescription of extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness who are not being prescribed any prophylactic anticoagulation for VTE prevention after discharge.\n\nSpecific Aim #2: To estimate the impact of electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) on the frequency of symptomatic VTE in high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness who are not being prescribed any prophylactic anticoagulation for VTE prevention after discharge.",
            "detailedDescription": "Design: U.S.-based, single-center, randomized controlled trial\n\nBackground: Hospitalized medical patients have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) across the continuum of care (from before admission to after discharge). In the APEX Trial of 7513 hospitalized patients with acute medical illness, reduced mobility, and risk factors for VTE, extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis with oral betrixaban for 35 to 42 days reduced the frequency of asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic proximal or distal DVT, symptomatic nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE), or VTE-related death by 24% in the overall study population compared with 10-14 days of enoxaparin. The integration of oral betrixaban with a computerized decision support (CDS) tool has the potential to increase the appropriate prescription of extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness.\n\nStudy Design: 400-patient U.S.-based single-center Quality Improvement Initiative in the form of a randomized controlled trial focused on the feasibility of implementation of this electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) (Figure 1). The allocation ratio will be 1:1 for an electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) notification versus no notification.\n\nStudy Population: Patients are eligible if they are \u226540 years of age, are hospitalized for acute medical illness (heart failure, respiratory failure, infectious disease, rheumatic disease, or ischemic stroke), have reduced mobility, and have one additional risk factor for VTE:\n\n1. Age \u226560\n2. Prior VTE\n3. History of cancer\n\nEligible patients are not prescribed thromboprophylaxis at hospital discharge.\n\nIntervention: An EPIC Electronic Health Record (EHR) Best Practice Advisory (BPA) will identify patients hospitalized with medical illness who are not ordered for extended-duration, post-discharge thromboprophylaxis 48 hours after admission. A first on-screen electronic alert will provide the clinician with the opportunity to consider extended-duration, post-discharge thromboprophylaxis and start any required processes for prior authorization or medication coverage. A second on-screen electronic alert will be issued if extended-duration, post-discharge thromboprophylaxis has still not been ordered that again notifies the provider about the increased risk for VTE after discharge and indication for thromboprophylaxis.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Outcome: Prescription of extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis. Investigators will review the order entry section of the Electronic Health Record (EPIC) to make this determination.\n\nSecondary Efficacy Outcome: Frequency of symptomatic VTE at 90 days from randomization. Investigators will review the notes and diagnostic testing sections of the Electronic Health Record (EPIC) to make this determination. The proposed study will not be powered to show a difference in clinical events, such as symptomatic VTE, with the electronic alert-based CDS but will provide estimates from which to plan a possible subsequent multi-center trial.\n\nPrimary Safety Outcome: Major bleeding (as defined by the ISTH bleeding classification system) at 90 days from randomization. Investigators will review the notes and diagnostic testing sections of the Electronic Health Record (EPIC) to make this determination. The proposed study will not be powered to show a difference in clinical events, such as bleeding, with the electronic alert-based CDS but will provide estimates from which to plan a possible subsequent multi-center trial.\n\nFollow-Up: Follow-up will consist of Electronic Health Record review at 90 days from randomization."
