            "briefSummary": "Depression among older Korean Americans are rising. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based intervention (EBI), effective for preventing depression relapse and reducing depressive symptoms. To enhance feasibility, acceptability, and reach, a brief version of MBCT has been developed and delivered by telephone (brief MBCT-T), but has only been tested in primarily White samples. This study will test test the effect of brief MBCT-T among older Korean Americans.",
            "detailedDescription": "Older Asians with limited English proficiency have experienced the greatest increase in depression before and during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. Social distancing measures to lower the risk of exposure to COVID-19, a diminishing social network, limited opportunities with social groups, and lack of access to culturally and linguistically relevant health information have all contributed to increased depression among older Asians. In addition, increases in hate speech and racist crimes against Asians have created a hostile living environment for older Asians, further contributing to depression.\n\nMindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective for preventing depression relapse and active depression. Our team has created a brief telephone-based MBCT which has been shown to be acceptable primarily white primarily white population. The acceptability of MBCT among older Korean Americans remain understudied.\n\nCommunity-based organizations (CBOs) are places for accessing federal and state programs, receiving culturally and linguistically appropriate health education, and supporting and socializing with other older Asians. Our preliminary study shows that 1) CBOs are ideal settings for offering MBCT-T because they have the infrastructure, capacity, cultural understanding, and trust of communities, and 2) many CBOs feel the urgency to address older Asians' escalating rates of depression and asked for assistance with training and implementation of MBCT-T.\n\nWe will partner with a CBO that serves large older Korean American population to conduct a pilot study to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact of a CBO delivered MBCT program on depression among older Korean Americans."
