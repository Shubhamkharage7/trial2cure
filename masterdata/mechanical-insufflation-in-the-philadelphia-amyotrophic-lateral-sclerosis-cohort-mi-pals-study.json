            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn how doing mechanical insufflation (MI) using a mechanical insufflator-exsufflator (MI-E) device affects breathing in early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This will be a single-center, single-arm study of MI in 20 patients with ALS at Penn.\n\nBased on prior research, we believe that 6-months of MI may slow decline in cough strength, measured as peak cough flow (PCF).\n\nParticipants will perform MI using a device designed for mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) known as the BiWaze Cough system. The BiWaze Cough is used for mucus clearance . It is connected to tubing and mouthpiece (or mask). The device will use programmed pressure and timing settings. An insufflation includes inflating the lungs for a maximal size inhalation before exhaling. The daily routine for the device includes 5 sets of 5 insufflations twice daily.\n\nResearchers will compare how use of MI in early ALS affects peak cough flow compared to 20 subjects who did not use MI in early ALS."

At MIC, the patient passively exhales, which completes one \"cycle\". Prior literature has used a \"dose\" of 5 sets of 5 cycles once or twice daily.
