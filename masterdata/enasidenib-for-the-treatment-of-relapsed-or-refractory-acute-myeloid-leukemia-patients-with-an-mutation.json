            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the side effects of enasidenib and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back after treatment (relapsed) or has been difficult to treat with chemotherapy (refractory). Patients must also have a specific genetic change, also called a mutation, in a protein called IDH2. Enasidenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the mutated IDH2 protein, which is needed for cell growth.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety of treatment with enasidenib mesylate (enasidenib) administered at continuous daily oral dosing for a 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant relapsed/refractory (R/R)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nII. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of enasidenib in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant R/R-AML.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of oncogenic metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) to enasidenib treatment in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant R/R-AML.\n\nII. To describe the clinical activity of enasidenib in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant R/R-AML.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy and collection of blood on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically up to 1 year."
