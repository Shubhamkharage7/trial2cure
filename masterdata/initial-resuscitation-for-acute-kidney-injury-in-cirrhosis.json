            "briefSummary": "The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate two strategies for how to provide intravenous (IV) fluids for treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis. The main question it aims to answer is: what is the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of providing a recommendation to use a Volume Assessment Guidance Algorithm (VAGA) or give standard of care doses of IV albumin?\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned where their treating teams will receive a VAGA-based recommendation or a standard of care IV albumin recommendation.",
            "detailedDescription": "This randomized, open-label, pilot feasibility trial will assess a volume assessment guidance algorithm (VAGA) in patients with AKI and cirrhosis. Eligible patients must have AKI and decompensated cirrhosis. In addition to assessing the adherence to the suggested guidance, this study will measure the effect of the study intervention on grams of albumin given, clinical efficacy outcomes (AKI response rates, survival, RRT status, transplant status), and safety.\n\nPatients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 where the treating clinicians will receive a one-time recommendation for volume resuscitation using the VAGA or standard of care IV albumin repletion (1 g/kg/day for two days). Both groups will be followed with assessments at 48 hours after randomization, hospital discharge, and 90-days after randomization.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome, grams of albumin, will be measured at 48 hours after randomization. Primary secondary efficacy outcomes (grams of albumin, AKI response) will be assessed at time of hospital discharge. If a patient undergoes liver transplantation or initiation of RRT during the admission, this will serve as a censoring date for these outcomes, and relevant data will be collected at the time of the first of these events.\n\nThe primary feasibility outcome is adherence to the suggested guidance, assessed at 48 hours after randomization. The VAGA group will receive one of three potential clinical recommendations: (a) no further volume resuscitation, (b) resuscitation with crystalloid, or (c) resuscitation with colloid.\n\nThis study will prospectively enroll approximately 50 adult patients at a single center."
