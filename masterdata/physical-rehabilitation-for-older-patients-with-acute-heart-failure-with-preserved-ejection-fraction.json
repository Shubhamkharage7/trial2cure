            "briefSummary": "The REHAB-HFpEF trial will determine whether a novel physical rehabilitation intervention will improve the primary outcome of combined all-cause rehospitalizations and mortality and the secondary outcome of major mobility disability during 6-month follow-up in patients hospitalized for heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is nearly unique to older persons, and for which there are few treatment options.",
            "detailedDescription": "REHAB-HFpEF, is a multicenter, randomized, attention-controlled, single-blind trial to examine the hypothesis that, a novel, tailored, progressive, multi-domain physical rehabilitation intervention administered to older patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) beginning early during hospitalization and continuing for 12 weeks in a structured outpatient setting, and continuing as a maintenance program will reduce the rate of combined all-cause rehospitalization and death at 6 months (the primary outcome), and reduce major mobility disability (MMD) prevalence at 6 months (the secondary outcome). This trial, REHAB-HFpEF, builds upon preliminary studies, including the phase 2 REHAB-HF trial, which suggests this intervention may yield significant benefits for this population which are largely older, frail, and with few evidence-based treatment options. Participants will be recruited from 20 clinical centers, each of which may have up to 3 tightly-affiliated 'satellite' sites geographically-close, under their direct management. Together, these centers will recruit a total of 880 consenting patients \\>=60 years old hospitalized with ADHF with HFpEF. Following informed consent and baseline testing, the participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive a novel, progressive, multi-domain rehabilitation and exercise training intervention or attention control. The intervention will include strength, balance, endurance, and mobility training and the specific training exercises will be tailored based on participant performance in each of these domains. The intervention will begin as soon as possible after randomization during the hospitalization and will continue 3 times per week in an outpatient setting for 12 weeks. Those randomized to the attention control will be contacted bi-weekly by study staff to maintain contact, collect information regarding health status, clinical events, and physical activity/exercise, and ensure retention; they do not receive any specific exercise recommendations. Both arms will receive all services ordered by their primary physician (usual care) and undergo measures of physical function, cognitive function, and quality of life (QOL)."
