            "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies how well thoracic epidural analgesia or four-quadrant transversus abdominus plane block works in reducing pain in patients undergoing liver surgery. It is not yet known whether thoracic epidural analgesia or four-quadrant transversus abdominus plane block may help people to recover more completely and more quickly after surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare length of hospital stay between patients treated with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) versus (vs.) pre-incision ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block after open liver resection within an enhanced recovery program.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the area under the curve of early (0-48 hour) post-operative pain scores and number of patients who experience severe postoperative pain between the TEA and TAP groups.\n\nII. To compare anesthetic-related complication rates and need to change modalities between TEA and TAP groups.\n\nIII. To compare surgery-related complications (including 30-day readmission and 90-day mortality rates) between TEA and TAP groups.\n\nIV. To compare return to baseline symptom burden, functional and cognitive status between TEA and TAP groups.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo placement of thoracic epidural catheter before surgery. Patients receive hydromorphone hydrochloride and bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter every 10 minutes or 3 hours as needed. Patients may receive fentanyl and bupivacaine or plain bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo placement of ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus abdominus plane block. Patients receive plain bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine via TAP block."
