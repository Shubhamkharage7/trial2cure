            "briefSummary": "Cycling has been a proven exercise for decades as a low impact option to strengthen the lower body and improve cardiovascular health. There is also evidence that cycling helps to stimulate the contraction of the muscles in the intestine. Other outcomes frequently examined when considering benefits of ambulation include decreased rates of venous thromboembolic events, pneumonia, and decreased hospital length of stays. Therefore, there is added value to consider alternate mobility modalities.",
            "detailedDescription": "Ileus is a common post operative occurrence, one that not only causes patient discomfort but also contributes to considerable economic impact and can potentially progress to other serious complications. Historically ileus has been difficult to define. Review of the literature produces a general definition to include a varying time frame upon which a patient is not tolerating an oral diet, unable to pass flatus or stool, symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and sometimes abdominal pain. Small bowel obstruction, while different pathophysiology than ileus, presents similar manifestations. Often ileus and small bowel obstruction follow the same pathway aimed at attempted resolution with attempts at conservative management. Efforts to resolve ileus and nonoperative small bowel obstruction include bowel rest, nasogastric decompression, and encouraging mobility. Many studies support the practice of mobilization through ambulation as an effort to encourage return of bowel function. What is lacking in review of the literature however are other modalities to offer the patient in efforts to assist and encourage patients to mobilize outside of ambulation."
