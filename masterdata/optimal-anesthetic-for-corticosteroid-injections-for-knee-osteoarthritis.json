Pain relief will be measured using the VAS pain score at the time of the injection as well as several time points following the injection to capture pain relief longevity. The investigators intend to evaluate how well the patients tolerate corticosteroid mixtures without anesthetic as well as with different volumes of anesthetic. Primary measure will be the time from procedure when postoperative status is considered success (as measured by global perceived improvement score).",

The investigators will measure the VAS pain score at the time of the injection as well as several time points following the injection. Additionally, the investigators will evaluate how long the injection provided pain relief for the patient.\n\nThe secondary intend is to evaluate how well the patients tolerate Kenalog mixtures without anesthetic as well as with different volumes of anesthetic by using the VAS pain scale.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that patient with lower volume of injection will experience less pain during the procedure and that there will be no statistically significant difference in pain level between the study groups during the study period."

We will only include patients who are receiving unilateral knee injections. Further, patient's baseline information on VAS Pain and current medication (analgesic or NSAID) will be collected. VAS Pain will be also collected immediately after the intervention and 2 minutes after the intervention, in addition to global perceived improvement score and AEs.\n\nThe intervention in this study is intra-articular knee injection of synthetic corticosteroid (kenalog) and variable amount of anesthetic (0ml, 2ml or 4 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine).",

The ARNP will open an envelope, administer injection based on the group assigned. The ARNP will prepare the medication to maintain the double blinded aspect of the study.
