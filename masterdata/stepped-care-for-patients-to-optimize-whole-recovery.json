Eligible participants will begin medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and will be randomized to receive SC-POWR (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), MOUD, and onsite groups for exercise \\[Wii Fit, Tai Chi\\] and stress reduction \\[relaxation training, auricular acupuncture\\] for 24 weeks. Participants will be followed for another 24 weeks to evaluate durability of treatment response illicit opioid use, alcohol use, pain interference, anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, and retention in MOUD (Aim 3).",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants who meet criteria for CP and OUD (N=316) will be initiated onto MOUD and randomized to 24 weeks of either treatment as usual (TAU) or 24 weeks of SC-POWR. SC-POWR patients will be \"stepped up\" according to a priori criteria. Patients randomized to SC-POWR will receive a behavioral intervention consisting of 12 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions over a 24 week period involving improvements in substance use and pain since baseline. Following 24 weeks of SC-POWR, patients are offered once monthly peer-support groups."
