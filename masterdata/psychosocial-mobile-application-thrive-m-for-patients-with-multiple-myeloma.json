            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial aims to evaluate whether a psychosocial mobile application (THRIVE-M), is efficacious for improving quality of life, psychological distress, and fatigue in patients living with multiple myeloma compared to usual care.",
            "detailedDescription": "Multiple myeloma, the second most common hematologic malignancy, can be associated with severe end-organ destruction and life-threatening complications (e.g., kidney failure, infection, anemia) resulting in significant morbidity (e.g., pain syndromes, fatigue). The protracted course and treatment of multiple myeloma is also characterized by physical symptoms that can undermine psychological well-being, functioning, and quality of life across the illness trajectory and care continuum.\n\nDespite the high psychological burden that may accompany life with multiple myeloma, the special mental health workforce needed to adequately address their psychological needs is limited. Hence, mobile application-delivered psychosocial interventions offer an innovative approach to overcome the shortage of psychosocial services to support the unique needs of patients living with multiple myeloma. With no psychosocial mobile application interventions for patients living with multiple myeloma, we developed a patient-centered, population-specific, mobile-application psychosocial intervention, THRIVE-M, tailored to the unique needs of patients living with multiple myeloma. With this study, we will establish the impact of THRIVE-M on patient-reported outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nThe study will use validated questionnaires to measure patients' quality of life, psychological distress symptoms, fatigue, and self-management targets like coping, spiritual well-being, and self-efficacy. Study questionnaires will be completed in the hospital or clinic, with an option to also complete them remotely via a secure web link or a mailed paper copy.\n\nDivine Mercy University is funding this research study."
