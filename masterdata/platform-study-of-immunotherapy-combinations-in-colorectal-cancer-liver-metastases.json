            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to to learn about different combinations of immunotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer whose cancer has spread to their liver and are planning to have surgery to remove tumor metastases from their liver. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* whether these combinations of immunotherapy change the tumor microenvironment in the liver\n* whether these combinations of immunotherapy are safe and effective when used in colorectal cancer with liver metastases\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of the following:\n\n* Botensilimab and balstilimab\n* Botensilimab, balstilimab, and AGEN1423\n* Botensilimab, balstilimab, and radiation\n\nParticipants will be asked to come in to receive drug infusions (and radiation, if applicable) before and after their surgical resection. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-center, 3-arm, randomized, open-label, phase II, screening study to assess the initial immunological changes in the tumor microenvironment in response to treatment with combination immunotherapy (Botensilimab/ Balstilimab), with or without radiation and/or additional TGF\u03b2-CD73 trap, in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases.\n\nParticipants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive one of 3 investigational treatment: botensilimab + balstilimab (Arm 1); botensilimab + balstilimab + AGEN1423 (Arm 2); or botensilimab + balstilimab + radiation (Arm 3). The study arms are not directly or formally compared with each other. It is established that the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have been predictive of patient survival following resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases. Immunotherapy combinations with an increase in the ratio of CD8+ T cells: Tregs will be considered for further investigation.\n\nAll participants will have a total of four treatment visits to receive immunotherapy infusions. Two visits will occur prior to surgery, each approximately 3 weeks apart. Surgery will be scheduled between day 28-42. After surgery, you will return for two more treatment visits. After the last dose of immunotherapy, participants will come to the clinic approximately 3 weeks and 3 months later for follow-up visits. Participants will be followed remotely for up to two years."
