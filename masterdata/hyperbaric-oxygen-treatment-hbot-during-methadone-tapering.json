            "briefSummary": "The aims of this study are to 1) explore the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) compared to sham treatment in relieving signs and symptoms (both physical and psychological) of opioid withdrawal in human subjects associated with methadone dose reductions; and 2): explore whether HBOT can increase the odds of successful methadone dose reduction in patients who are interested in tapering their opioid dose. The investigators aim to explore, through qualitative methods, individual's experiences with treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD).",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized, sham treatment-controlled trial to examine the efficacy of HBOT for improving signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in methadone-maintained OUD patients as they undergo two planned methadone dose reductions spaced two weeks apart.\n\nA participant sample size of 24 was chosen based on power analysis guided by the investigators' earlier study that indicate that clinically meaningful results can be found with a minimum of 8 per group related to variables of highest interest i.e., pain and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAdditionally to this trial, participants will be asked to partake in a semi-structured interview in which they will be asked to discuss (1) Beginning Treatment, (2) Life in Recovery, and (3) HBOT \\& Further Treatment."
