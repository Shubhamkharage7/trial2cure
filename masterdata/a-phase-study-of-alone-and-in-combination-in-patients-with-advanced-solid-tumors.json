Histologically confirmed locally advanced/metastatic HGSOC, including PPC and FTC, that progressed on, refused, or ineligible to maintenance treatment with a PARPi, and who have platinum-sensitive disease, defined by platinum free interval of more than 6 months e) mCRPC cohort: i. Subjects with metastatic, castration-resistant adenocarcinoma of the prostate with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation, that progressed on, or was intolerant, refused, or ineligible to PARPi.\n\n   f) HRRm advanced solid tumors cohort: i.

Chemotherapy or small molecule-targeted therapy \\< 3 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.\n   2. Any antibody therapy \\< 5 half-lives from first dose of study treatment (or 4 weeks since last therapy, whichever is the shortest).\n   3. Chemotherapy with nitrosoureas or mitomycin C \\< 6 weeks from first dose of study treatment.\n   4.

Lactating or pregnant females.\n5. Clinically relevant cardiovascular disease\n6. Known history of myelodysplastic syndrome.\n7. Other severe, acute, or chronic medical condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or that may interfere with the interpretation of the study results, and in the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for the study.\n8.
