Furthermore, the study will investigate the used intubation techniques and identify possible improvement measures to increase patient safety.",
            "detailedDescription": "It is a prospective observational multi-centre study collecting health related patient data over a period of three months. This serves best the study's purpose to detect the incidence and nature of problems related to tracheal intubation and how such problems are handled with the aim to further improve patient safety. During the observational period the anaesthesia staff in charge will complete a screening questionnaire for critical events associated with tracheal intubation for every patient undergoing general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation. If no critical events arise there are no further requirements. If a critical event occurs, the anaesthesia provider will complete a more detailed questionnaire which includes more questions about what exactly happened.\n\nPatient characteristics will be extracted from the anaesthesia records. The investigators will extract such data for all patients undergoing tracheal intubation and additional data for those with critical events. The research will not intervene with the clinical conduct of patient care.\n\nThe collected health related data will be transferred to an electronic research data base. In this data base data will be encoded. Every patient with a critical event will be followed up as described above."
