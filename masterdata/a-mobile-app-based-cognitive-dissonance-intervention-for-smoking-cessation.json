            "briefSummary": "This research study aims to develop a cognitive dissonance-based mobile app for smoking cessation (CoQuit) and test the efficacy of the app with 500 adult smokers who express a desire to quit smoking.",
            "detailedDescription": "This research project will evaluate the CoQuit mobile app for smoking cessation by having 500 daily adult smokers recruited through social media and randomized to either the CoQuit app or an app that has similar content but no tasks for inducing cognitive dissonance among participants. Outcomes will be measured at 1- and 3-months post-baseline and will include quit attempts, number of days without smoking (smokefree days), and changes in smoking attitudes and behavior, and smoking abstinence. Usability data, system log data on program use, and participant satisfaction data will also be analyzed.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that individuals using the cognitive dissonance intervention (CDI) will show greater increases in quit attempts, smoke free days, quit rates, and positive smoking attitudes and behaviors than individuals in the active comparison condition. The researchers will test whether gender, smoking dependence, readiness to quit, previous quit attempts, age of smoking initiation, and socio-economic status moderate intervention effects on smoking outcomes."
