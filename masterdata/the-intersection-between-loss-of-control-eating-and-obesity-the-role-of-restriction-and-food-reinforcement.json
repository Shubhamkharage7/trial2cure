In order to achieve this aim, the investigators will follow children over the course of a year, obtaining behavioral and observational measurements, in addition to a two-week restricted access and two week non-restricted access period.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study will be mostly observational but will also include a randomized, cross-over design (the restricted access paradigm). The investigators will recruit children at risk for obesity in Erie County, New York (N=100, 50 boys, 50 girls). The study will include 4 visits at baseline and follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months. At the first visit, the participants will complete consent, height/weight/body fat, questionnaires, and complete a delayed discount task and the relative reinforcing value task. The participants will be randomized to have two weeks of restricted access first or two weeks of non-restricted access first, and then will come into the laboratory to do the loss of control test meal. Then they will have a one-week washout period, and will then complete the other two weeks of restricted/not restricted access. Following this, they will complete the loss of control test meal again. At the follow-up visits, participants will come into the laboratory to have their height/weight/body fat measured, complete questionnaires, and complete the delayed discounting task, food reinforcement and loss of control test meals. Participants will be compensated for their time after each visit. The details of the measures and procedures are outlined below."
