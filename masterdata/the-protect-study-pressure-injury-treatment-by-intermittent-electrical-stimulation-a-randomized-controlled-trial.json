            "detailedDescription": "This is a two-arm, prospective randomized control trial assessing whether IES combined with the standard of care (treatment) is superior to the standard of care alone (control). The study is a parallel design, adaptive, non-blinded randomized controlled trial, and uses two-sided analysis. We plan interim analyses at each 25% of the N. Part of the early interim analyses (first and second) will involve reassessing the a priori assumptions on data distributions and variability use in sample size calculations and updating the study size needed. Treatment effect results will be shared with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether the study should be ended early for either futility or having demonstrated superiority of the intervention. Patients can be entered into the protocol multiple times with independent assessments of inclusion/exclusion criteria and new consent for each enrollment. At each enrollment they will be re-randomized to either experimental or control arm. For the purpose of overall survival analysis (the only endpoint with a delayed assessment of outcome), such patients will be excluded.\n\nThis trial studies adult inpatients in both ICU and non-ICU environments with either new or established stage 1 or stage 2 sacral and ischial pressure injuries. Patients with a pacemaker/AICD, rhabdomyolysis, gluteal skin breakdown, and unstable fractures at risk of displacement by IES are excluded. Patients with atrial or ventricular wires after cardiac surgery can be enrolled as long as they are not being paced or in the opinion of the treating physician are at high risk of requiring pacing.\n\nSubjects will be assessed for pressure injury status from point of randomization to discharge, death, or a minimum of 30 days. Device utilization and data collection can stop after 14 days in a non-ICU environment or when a total of 30 days of data collection has been met. If subjects are in the ICU longer than 30 days or when the combined total of ICU and less than 14 non-ICU days is greater than 30 days, the assessment and use of the device may continue after 30 days. Following entry into the study, participants will receive either the IES device in addition to the standard of care (treatment group) or the standard of care alone (control group). The study is expected to complete accrual within 12-18 months. Participant treatment will occur for the same amount of time as pressure injury assessment occurs as described above."
