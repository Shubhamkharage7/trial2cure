Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level \u2264 1.5 \u2264 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)\\[except if Gilberts syndrome and then total bilirubin \u2264 3x is allowed\\], an AST, level \u2264 2.5 x ULN, and an ALT level \u2264 2.5 x ULN. If liver metastases are present, then AST and ALT levels must be \u2264 4 x ULN\n9.

Has a diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency (excluding IgA deficiency).\n4. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the study subject's best interest to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n5.
