TENS is a procedure in which mild electric currents are applied to some areas of the skin to potentially improve neuropathy. This trial may help determine if TENS is feasible and effective for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy symptoms while on chemotherapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility of daily transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) by measuring participant adherence to TENS for two weeks.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the change in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures of symptoms (e.g. pain, tingling, numbness) and functional impairment.\n\nII. To evaluate the change in objective measures of neuropathy over the study period through bedside monofilament testing.\n\nTERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To collect data on the type and use frequency of non-TENS chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) treatments (e.g. neuropathic agents and doses) both at baseline and over the duration of the trial (six weeks).\n\nII. To measure the number of chemotherapy dose-limiting events (dose reductions, delays, discontinuations) over the duration of the trial.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo TENS therapy at home daily over 1 hour for 14 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity."
