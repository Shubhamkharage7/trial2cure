Determine the prevalence of HPV-associated premalignant lesions in the anus and penis in Indian HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Describe risk factors for prevalent premalignant lesions in the anus and penis in Indian HIV-seropositive MSM.\n\nII. Describe the prevalence and incidence of penile and anal HPV infection in Indian HIV-seropositive MSM.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants receive a questionnaire and undergo a targeted physical and anal clinical exam at months 0, 6, and 12. Participants also undergo a penile skin cell and anal swab at months 0, 6, and 12 for cytology, HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and CD4+ T-cell count at months 0 and 6 and HIV viral load testing at months 0 and 12.
