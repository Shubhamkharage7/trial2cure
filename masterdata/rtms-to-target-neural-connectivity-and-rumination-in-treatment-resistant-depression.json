            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to part of the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) can treat a symptom called rumination in adults with major depression that has not responded to at least one medication trial. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\nDoes TMS to the VMPFC change brain activity on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a negative self-referential processing task in adults with depression? Does TMS to the VMPFC affect rumination in adults with depression? Researchers will compare brain scans and rumination scores before, during, and immediately after TMS.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nUndergo three functional MRI scans Undergo a course of 20 TMS treatments Respond to clinical questionnaires and complete a computer behavioral task",
            "detailedDescription": "This will be a single-site, pilot, open-label, within-subject design study. 20 participants with treatment-resistant depression, defined as a failure to respond to at least one antidepressant medication trial within a current major depressive episode, will be recruited. Prior to intervention, participants will undergo self-report and clinician-administered assessments (in-person or virtual with both audio and video on using secure health telecommunication method), as well as a fMRI during resting state and a self-referential processing task. The baseline scan will also include a high-resolution structural sequence for neuronavigational purposes. Then, participants will receive 20 daily (5 days/week) sessions of rTMS to the VMPFC along with weekly assessments. Participants will undergo a repeated fMRI scan early in the course of treatment (after session 5) when we would expect neural changes to be evident but prior to any robust overall antidepressant effect, as well as at the end of the rTMS course (after session 20). Scores on the depression and rumination scales will be recorded prior to intervention and weekly thereafter. Contact with subjects will be conducted once via telephone at two weeks after the end of study intervention as an adverse event assessment. In the event that new or persistent adverse events felt to be related to the study intervention occur following the termination of study procedures, subjects may be brought in for further safety assessments."
