Participants will be recruited into this study and will be presented with one of three uniform light stimuli via a wide-field ganzfeld in three conditions to determine the retinal mechanisms that reduce pain. This work will lead to a greater understanding of retinal mechanisms that contribute to pain and will assist the design of future studies to harness the potential of light based pain therapies."
