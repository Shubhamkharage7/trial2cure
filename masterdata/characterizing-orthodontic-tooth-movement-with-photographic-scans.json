            "detailedDescription": "The accuracy and reliability of Dental Monitoring scans is be evaluated and compared to that of iTero digital scans during maxillary canine retraction. The magnitude and type of tooth movement occurring in a one month period in patients undergoing maxillary canine retraction will be measured. Patients undergoing orthodontic treatment in the Center for Orthodontic Care at UConn Health will be evaluated for the inclusion criteria. A total of twenty patients whose orthodontic treatment plan required extraction of at least one premolar in the maxillary arch will be recruited. The patient will be required to take photographs and video scans as dictated by Dental Monitoring (DM) on the first and final days of the study period (four weeks), while iTero scans are taken by the provider in clinic on these same days. Patient will also be periodically taking photographic scans at home using Dental Monitoring. The DM scans taken by the patient will be compared to the iTero digital scans taken by the provider. This can be done by superimposing the stereolithographic (STL) files created from each scan and assessing the amount of deviation between the 3D models. The types of tooth movement occurring during canine retraction in buccolingual, mesiodistal, and incisogingival planes will be quantified using Doctor Dashboard software available in DM. DM's 3D matching technology allows superimposition of teeth from each 3D model created per scan. Each tooth and its movements are graphed in a detailed manner to provide precise information about its type of movement."
