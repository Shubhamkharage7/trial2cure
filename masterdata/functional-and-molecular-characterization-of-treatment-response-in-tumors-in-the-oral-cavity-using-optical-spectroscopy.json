This study will be performed in a total of 90 patients that have Stage 3 or 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with primary tumors located in the larynx or one tonsil.",

This study will be performed in a total of 90 patients that have Stage 3 or 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with primary tumors located in the larynx or one tonsil.\n\nThis study is a single-arm, single-center observational pilot study of the accuracy of DRS+RS at distinguishing early between treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive disease in study-eligible subjects undergoing first-line chemoradiation therapy for Stage 3 or 4 HNSCC of the larynx or tonsil.\n\nThree (3) optical spectra each will be collected from the tumor, an adjacent normal site, and a normal tissue site on the buccal mucosa prior to treatment. The subject will undergo 4 repeat post-treatment measures taken after radiation therapy begins (marked as Day 1). Repeat measures will be taken on Day 2(+1), Day 4(\u00b11), Day 7(\u00b11), and Day 10(\u00b11). The probe will be performed at the beginning of the radiation therapy visit, prior to the radiation dose that day."
