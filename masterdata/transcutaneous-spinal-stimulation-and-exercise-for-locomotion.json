            "briefSummary": "Growing evidence indicates that electrical spinal cord stimulation improves motor functions both immediately and over the long term via modulating the excitability of spinal circuitry in patients with spinal cord injury. Recently, a novel, non-invasive, well-tolerated, and painless lumbosacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation strategy was demonstrated to be effective in improving lower limb motor function in participants with spinal cord injury. Our current project, cervical transcutaneous electrical stimulation and intensive exercise for arms and hands are also revealing a significant improvement in upper extremity function. Additionally, the subject and caregiver noted that stair climbing ability has been substantially enhanced starting from the first week of cervical stimulation treatment and continues to date.\n\nThis study is a prospective efficacy trial of combined transcutaneous cervical and lumbosacral electrical stimulation with intensive physical therapy for improving locomotion in people with incomplete tetraplegia and paraplegia.\n\nThis experiment design consists of two to four-phase intervention programs, including one-month physical therapy only followed by one-month spinal stimulation combined with physical therapy. Between each intervention, washout periods of up to one month may be used to determine any after-effects of the interventions. The intervention arms will be repeated if the functional improvement does not reach a plateau during the first two months of interventions. Sessions will last up to 2 hours/day, 2 to 5 days/week for each arm. Both immediate and lasting improvements in lower extremity function and autonomic function via transcutaneous spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy will be evaluated."
