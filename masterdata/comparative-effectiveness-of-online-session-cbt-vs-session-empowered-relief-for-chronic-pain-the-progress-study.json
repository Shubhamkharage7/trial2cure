The investigators aim to understand for patients which treatment works best.\n\nOnline evidence-based behavioral treatment for pain will greatly expand access to patients across the U.S. living with diverse chronic pain conditions. Results from this study will fill several critical gaps in evidence that are preventing patients and physicians from making informed decisions about their pain care.\n\nThis study will provide a low-cost, relatively low-risk, widely available and feasible protocol that directly addresses the needs of millions of community-based outpatients and their physicians."
