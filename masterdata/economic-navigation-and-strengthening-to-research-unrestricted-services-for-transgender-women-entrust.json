            "detailedDescription": "There continues to be a gap in the extant literature on the relationship between substance abuse and achievement of viral suppression (VS) through adherent antiretroviral treatment (ART) or PrEP uptake among transgender women which warrants further investigation. Harmful alcohol and illicit drug use associated with substance use disorders (SUD) have been independently linked to condomless sex and hinder engagement in ending the HIV epidemic (EHE) prevention initiatives, including HIV retention in care and adherence to treatment to achieve viral suppression and PrEP use.\n\nTransgender women are among the most at risk group of sexually active populations, yet least likely to be aware of and/or use preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission.5 PrEP and routine HIV/STI screening, are effective approaches to reduce HIV incidence in marginalized at-risk populations and are consistent with the US National HIV/AIDS strategy."
