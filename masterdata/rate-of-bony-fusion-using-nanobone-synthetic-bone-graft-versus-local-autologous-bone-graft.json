            "briefSummary": "The objectives of this longitudinal study are to assess and measure fusion status (fused or not fused) and rate of bony fusion using NanoBone\u00ae Synthetic Bone Graft in patients requiring one to two level lumbar posterolateral fusion procedures with or without commercially available rigid spinal instrumentation. Our hypothesis is that the Nanobone synthetic bone graft will be as effective at creating a fusion in the lumbar spine as compared with a local bone graft. Each subject will serve as their own control during this study, as patients will receive the Nanobone graft on the right side of their spine and the local bone graft on their left side.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects will be recruited for this study from among those scheduled to undergo 1-2 level posterolateral spinal fusion procedures with bone grafting for degenerative disc disease or grade 1-3 spondylolisthesis. The study will entail each subject having a local bone graft placed on the left side of their spine, with Nanobone placed on the right side of their spine during the procedure. Eligible and consenting patients recruited for this study will be subject to the standard of care. This includes the following visits: preoperative, operative, post-discharge, 4 months postoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-years postoperative. They will be subject to standard of care imaging modalities including AP, lateral, and flexion/extension lumbar radiographs at pre-operative, post-discharge, 4-months postoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-year postoperative time points. Standard of care advanced imaging including a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed pre-operatively. Patients will also receive standard of care clinical examinations and self-assessments at all clinic visits. Imaging obtained outside the standard of care for this study will include 1-year and 2-year lumbar CT scans to evaluate fusion. The 2-year lumbar CT scan will only be required if fusion has not been demonstrated at the time of the 1-year lumbar CT scan. Patients enrolled in this study who are treated with rigid pedicle screw fixation must be treated using rigid pedicle screw instrumentation appropriate for posterolateral spinal fusions."
