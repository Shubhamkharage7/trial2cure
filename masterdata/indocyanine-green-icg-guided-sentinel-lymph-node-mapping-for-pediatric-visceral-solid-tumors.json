This dye will be used to help the surgeon find lymph nodes draining solid tumors inside the abdomen that need to be removed. This may also help the surgeon to find if the cancer has moved to other lymph nodes outside of the known area.\n\nPrimary Objectives\n\n* To determine the percentage of patients in whom Indocyanine Green (ICG)-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was successful at the time of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for staging of visceral solid tumors.\n* To determine the percentage of patients with grade 3 or higher adverse events related to ICG use.",
            "detailedDescription": "During surgery, participants will be given the dye to help the doctor see the lymph nodes to be removed. Pictures or a video of the procedure will be done. The number of lymph nodes removed will be recorded. After surgery, the lymph nodes will be examined.\n\nParticipants will be followed for up to 24 hours after surgery to determine if there were any side effects from the dye."
