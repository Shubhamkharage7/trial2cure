            "detailedDescription": "There is a strong correlation between plasma erythritol concentrations and adverse cardiovascular events in high risk individuals. It has also been demonstrated that consumption of dietary erythritol leads to high levels of plasma erythritol. There is in vitro evidence that erythritol at comparable concentrations promotes platelet activation. However, there is no direct evidence that links human consumption of erythritol with the onset of platelet activation and adhesion leading to inflammation. The investigators seek to fill this evidence gap by conducting a randomized crossover dietary intervention study in which human participants will consume beverages sweetened with erythritol or aspartame, each for two weeks."
