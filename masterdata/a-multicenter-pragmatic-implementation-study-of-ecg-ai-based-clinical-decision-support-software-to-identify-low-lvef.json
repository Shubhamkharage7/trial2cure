The study will be conducted in 2 phases: feasibility assessment phase and clinical impact phase.",
            "detailedDescription": "The study is a prospective, cluster randomized, care-as-usual controlled trial that will be conducted at 6 sites in the USA.\n\nPrimary care clinicians and general cardiologists will be invited and consented to participate in the study. For clinicians that accept, practice groups will be randomized to receive access to and education about the Low EF AI-ECG software and encompassing software or to provide care-as-usual in the control group. The study will be conducted in two phases: a feasibility pilot to evaluate integration and usability followed by observational period(s) to evaluate clinical outcomes.\n\nAnalyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted on data from patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The expected duration of the study is 12 months, including a feasibility phase (estimated 6 weeks) followed by a 3-month initial observation period with rolling observation count monitoring until the target number of patient encounters is reached, followed by a 90-day follow up period.\n\nAt the completion of the feasibility period, we will evaluate quantitative and qualitative outcomes to inform the following observational period(s).\n\nPrimary endpoints and exploratory endpoints will be assessed the end of the study."
