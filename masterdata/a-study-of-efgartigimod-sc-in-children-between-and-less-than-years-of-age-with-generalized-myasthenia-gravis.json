The primary goal is to confirm an appropriate dose of efgartigimod PH20 SC for pediatric patients using PK and PD results from this study. Participants will receive injections of efgartigimod PH20 SC and will be monitored for safety until the end of the study. At the end of the follow-up period, eligible participants may roll over to an open-label extension (OLE) study.\n\nThe participants will be in the study for up to 14 weeks."
