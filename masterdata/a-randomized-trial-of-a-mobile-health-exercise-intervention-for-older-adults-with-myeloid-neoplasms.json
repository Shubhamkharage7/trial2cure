We will also explore the effect of the intervention on TNF\u03b1 and related cytokine gene promoter methylation and their gene and protein expression.",
            "detailedDescription": "Up to 98% of older patients with myeloid neoplasms experience physical function decline, fatigue, and mood disturbances. Mobile health exercise interventions are promising strategy to prevent physical function decline and improve fatigue and mood disturbances, but older patients with myeloid neoplasms receiving outpatient chemotherapy are understudied. The proposed study will investigate whether a novel mobile health exercise intervention that is adapted to this population can prevent physical function decline, improve fatigue and mood disturbances, and prevent worsening quality of life."
