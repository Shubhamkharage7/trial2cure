In addition, dostarlimab will be given as monotherapy (Arm D); and in combination with belrestotug (Arm E); and with GSK6097608 + belrestotug (Arm F) in Japanese and Chinese participants. The study may assess the PK/PD cohorts for Arm E and/or Arm F in participants outside of China and Japan. Additionally, dostarlimab will be given in combination with cobolimab in Japanese participants. Drug name mentioned as belrestotug, GSK4428859A and EOS884448 are interchangeable for the same compound. In the rest of the document, the drug will be referred to as belrestotug."
