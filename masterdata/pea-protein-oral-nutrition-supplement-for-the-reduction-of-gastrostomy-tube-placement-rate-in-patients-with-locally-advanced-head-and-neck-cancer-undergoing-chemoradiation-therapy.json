            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of a plant-based oral nutrition supplement, Kate Farms Standard 1.4 and/or Standard 1.0. as a primary source of nutrition in reducing the gastrostomy tube placement rate in patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and who are undergoing chemoradiation therapy. Gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement can be used for enteral feedings and may lead to long term side effects such as swallowing dysfunction and lead to higher rates of permanent G-tube dependence. The Kate Farms pea protein oral nutrition supplement is formulated with organic, planted-based protein for easier digestibility without artificial sweeteners or additives and without common allergens such as dairy, soy, gluten or corn. It is nutritionally complete, calorie and protein dense and available in multiple flavors that can be consumed directly or as a base for other recipes. Giving pea protein oral nutrition supplement may provide nutritional support to decrease the need for therapeutic G-tube rate during chemoradiation compared to standard supportive care.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the therapeutic G-tube placement rate during chemoradiation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine percent weight change during and following treatment. II. To determine body mass index (BMI) changes during and following treatment. III. To determine changes in nutrition status based on Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria IV. To determine lean body mass before and after treatment via psoas muscle surrogate measurement on routine staging scans.\n\nV. To determine the adherence rate of Kate Farms oral nutritional replacement. VI. To determine changes in oral and gastrointestinal microbiota via 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing during and following treatment in an exploratory analysis.\n\nVII. To determine changes in biomarkers during treatment. VIIa. Serum human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic (DNA). VIIb. 38-multiplex immune cytokine and chemokine panel in an exploratory analysis.\n\nVIIc. Complete metabolic panel, complete blood count with differential, C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\nVIId. Radiosensitivity germ-line biomarker panel. VIII. To determine physician-reported acute and late toxicities during and following treatment.\n\nVIIIa. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. IX. To determine patient-reported quality of life during and following treatment.\n\nIXa. University of Washington and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaires.\n\nIXb. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head \\& Neck (FACT-H\\&N). X. To determine clinical outcomes from treatment. Xa. Local/Locoregional control. Xb. Distant metastasis-free survival. Xc. Overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive Kate Farms pea protein oral nutrition supplement orally (PO) during their mealtimes as directed by their clinical dietitian during and up to 1 month following chemoradiation in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up for a minimum of 2 years."
