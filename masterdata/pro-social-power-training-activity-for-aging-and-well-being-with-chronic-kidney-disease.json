The intervention will contain in-center and at-home components. It will lay the foundation for a large-scale future randomized controlled efficacy trial aimed to reduce frailty risk among Veterans with advanced chronic kidney disease. 30 other Veterans will be part of an attention control.\n\nThe outcomes of this pilot trial are feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity. Each of these outcomes will be measured using quantitative surveys and data review as well as qualitative assessments among Veterans at trial close. As this is a pilot feasibility trial, it is intentionally not powered to detect whether the intervention has a significant effect on physical activity frequency, muscle strength, or physical frailty."
