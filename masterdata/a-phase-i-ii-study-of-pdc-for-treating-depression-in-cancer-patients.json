The MADRS is administered by a trained interviewer. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6, with anchors at 2-point intervals; higher scores indicating more severity (i.e., ranging from 0 \\[no sadness\\] to 6 \\[extremely despondent\\]). The total score is used to define treatment response (\u226550% reduction from baseline) and partial response (20-49% reduction from baseline). Remission is defined as a score of \\< 10. The following are used as an interpretation of scores:\n\n0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression \\>34 - severe depression",
