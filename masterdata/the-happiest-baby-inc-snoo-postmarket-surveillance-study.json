This study will survey 1000 caregivers of high-risk infants to examine the frequency of death or serious injury occurring in the SNOO Bassinet.",
            "detailedDescription": "Synopsis:\n\nThis postmarket surveillance study will evaluate the ongoing safety of the Happiest Baby, Inc. SNOO Smart Sleeper in accordance with the order issued under Section 522 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, issued March 30, 2023\n\nThe study will measure rates of adverse events occurring in the SNOO bassinet from a prospectively screened cohort of 1000 infants determined to be at high risk for SUID. The primary endpoints quantify device-related serious injury and/or device-related death. The secondary endpoints include an analysis of SNOO usage patterns in the enrolled population, including infant age during SNOO use, duration of SNOO use, and weaning rationale.\n\nProcedures:\n\nProspective participants who have purchased or rented SNOO during the study enrollment period will be invited to participate in an electronic eligibility screening survey 1-month after their purchase/rental ship date. Eligible participants will subsequently be invited to participate in a 6-month follow up survey (7 months after their purchase/rental ship date, 6 months post-enrollment) soliciting self-reported outcomes for the study endpoints. The screening and survey questionnaires will be conducted electronically via Qualtrics using a link provided by email, and which may be completed on a smart phone, tablet, or computer.\n\nAs enrolled eligible participants complete their final surveys, responses indicating the occurrence of adverse events will be investigated, classified according to severity and device-relatedness, documented, and reported. A final clinical evaluation of the observed SUID rate will be conducted, and will include reference to demographically-matched population statistics pulled from the CDC WONDER database. A full characterization of adverse events and any demographic or usage-related correlates will be reported to the FDA as part of this investigation."
