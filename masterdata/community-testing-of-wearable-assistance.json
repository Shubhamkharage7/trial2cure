Following device fitting, the participants will practice walking with powered assistance.\n\nNext, participants will complete \"pre\" walking tests with and without the device (order randomized) on a 15-minute pre planned community walk in close proximity with their own home. Distance, time, heart-rate, and perceived exertion will be recorded. The expected duration is 1-2 hours.\n\nNext, participants will be asked to complete (under parental supervision for minors) the pre-determined walking route every day for 1 week with or without ankle exoskeleton assistance (block randomized). Following the first week of independent walking practice, participants will complete \"post\" walking tests with and without the device on the same walking route. Distance, time, heart-rate, and perceived exertion will be recorded. The expected duration is 1-2 hours.\n\nParticipants will then have a 2-6 week washout period.\n\nFollowing this washout, the pre- and post-assessments will be completed before and after, respectively, another week of identical community walking practice completed under the remaining condition (either exoskeleton or no exoskeleton)."
