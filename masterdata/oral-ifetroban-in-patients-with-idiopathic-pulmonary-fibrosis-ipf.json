Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive oral ifetroban or placebo once daily for 12 months. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two oral treatment groups: ifetroban or placebo and block randomized by background therapy. All subjects who receive treatment will be assessed for safety. All subjects with at least one efficacy assessment post-baseline will be evaluated for efficacy. Blood and urine will be collected for standard and novel PPF biomarkers."
