            "briefSummary": "This phase 1/2 trial will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose Selection) is designed to find the dose of dapansutrile with acceptable tolerability in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 1 will consist of up to 2 dose selection cohorts to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant melanoma to find the recommended part 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 will include a lead-in phase of dapansutrile monotherapy at 500 mg PO BID. At day 15, combination therapy with pembrolizumab will be initiated. Dose escalation is planned to a maximum of 1000 mg BID of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab.\n\nPart 2 (Dose Expansion) is designed to assess preliminary efficacy of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in PD-1 resistant melanoma. Once all patients in Part 1 have completed 4 weeks of dapansutrile therapy, the expansion phase will start enrolling. Part 2 will also include a 14-day lead-in period of dapansutrile monotherapy at the RP2D."

Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue, but archived sample can be used at baseline provided that the patient has only had anti-PD-1/L1 based regimen since obtaining the sample.\n    2. Biopsies may be taken from any amenable lesion, but it is preferable to use the same lesion throughout.\n    3. Biopsy may be taken from previously irradiated lesions only if they have progressed since radiation therapy.\n    4. Patient may still be eligible for study if tumor is not amenable to safe biopsy or biopsy is judged by patient or treating physician to not be in their best interest.\n11.

Total bilirubin \u22641.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin \u2264ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels \\> 1.5 x ULN\n    6. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) \u22642.5 x ULN (\u22645 x ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n    7. International normalized ratio (INR) OR prothrombin time (PT) \u22641.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n    8. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) \u22641.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants NOTE: Criteria must be met without erythropoietin dependency and without packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion within the last 2 weeks NOTE: Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard\n13. Prior adverse events from anticancer therapy must be resolved to \u2264 grade 1, with the exception of alopecia or endocrinopathies, which may be on replacement therapy.
