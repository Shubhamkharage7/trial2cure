The investigators aim to more reliably obtain higher quality fetal MRI images when compared to current clinical fetal MRI.",
            "detailedDescription": "The main aim of this project is to evaluate and optimize the existing clinical magnetic resonance (MR) techniques for fetal imaging, and to also implement and test new MR technologies that would improve fetal imaging in general. This involves the development of new pulse sequences and image acquisition schemes that \"freeze\" fetal motion and hence provide improved image quality and robustness for both structural (T1- and T2- weighted, susceptibility and FLAIR imaging) and physiological imaging (diffusion, perfusion, spectroscopy, resting-state functional MRI, etc). The scope of this project also includes testing of newly developed radio frequency (RF) receive-only coil arrays that would inherently provide the means for faster imaging of the fetus, and thus complement the software developments."
