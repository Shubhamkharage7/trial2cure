The Study Investigator will compare standard of care mucositis prevention rinses with the VCO mouth rinse added to the standard of care mucositis prevention rinses. The severity of oral mucositis between the 2 groups will be evaluated. Some of the standard of care rinses that can be used to prevent mucositis are normal saline, Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Mylanta, lidocaine, or other combinations.",

The target population is patients \u2265 7 years to 26 years at time of consent who are planning to undergo myeloablative conditioning regimens in preparation HSCT. The study will be conducted at Levine Children's Hospital, Levine Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Clinic and Atrium Health. Subjects will be screened and consented within 28 days prior to admission. The planned treatment period for Arm A (standard of care with the addition of VCO mouth rinses) or Arm B (standard of care) will begin at the start of subject's admission for conditioning, followed by transplant event with day of transplant defined as Day 0 and continue through Day +45 following transplant or hospital discharge, whichever comes first. A Safety Follow Up Visit will occur no sooner than 30 days from last study drug treatment"
