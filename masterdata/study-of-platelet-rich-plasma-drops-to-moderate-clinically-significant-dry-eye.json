They will be asked to blink naturally fixate on the laser spot throughout the measurement protocol. While subjects fixate, the wavefront sensor delivers a brief flash of light to the subjects' retina. The light reflected out of the subjects' eye is collected to obtain measurements of wavefront aberrations of the eye. For optical quality assessments the measurements of wavefront aberrations will be acquired along the line-of-sight. The wavefront data acquired from the wavefront sensor will be described by Zernike coefficients, the most popular mathematical way to represent the ocular aberrations.",
