Limited existing literature demonstrates the need for contraceptive counseling that moves beyond cis- and heteronormative assumptions that start with pregnancy prevention and address concerns at the intersection of gender identity.\n\nThe Investigator's qualitative study will focus on creating best practices regarding equitable contraceptive counseling for TGD youth. The Investigator will recruit transgender youth who are assigned female at birth, and currently or interested in using depo medroxyprogesterone (DMPA). Through focus groups and semi-structured interviews, the investigator hopes to guide providers in creating best practices and more equitable contraceptive counseling for TGD youth and measure satisfaction of DMPA in TGD youth.",
            "detailedDescription": "Recommendations regarding contraceptive counseling and reproductive health differ amongst transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth compared to cis-gender youth. TGD youth face unique health disparities including increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, sexual abuse and violence, and unwanted pregnancies. TGD youth also face inequities within the healthcare system including lack of access to providers and delay or avoidance of care. Both patients and providers also have misconceptions around pregnancy risk in transgender individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB) who are sexually active with people assigned male at birth. Limited existing literature demonstrates the need for contraceptive counseling that moves beyond cis- and heteronormative assumptions that start with pregnancy prevention and address concerns at the intersection of gender identity.\n\nThe Investigator's qualitative study will focus on creating best practices regarding equitable contraceptive counseling for TGD youth. The Investigator will recruit transgender youth who are AFAB, and currently or interested in using depo medroxyprogesterone (DMPA). Through focus groups and semi-structured interviews, the investigator hopes to gain the perspectives of and experiences of TGD youth with self-and clinic- administered DMPA. The investigator hopes the results of this study can guide providers in creating best practices and more equitable contraceptive counseling and measure to satisfaction of DMPA for TGD youth."
