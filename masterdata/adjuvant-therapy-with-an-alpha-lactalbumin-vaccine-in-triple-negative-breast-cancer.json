            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety as well as the most effective dose of the alpha-lactalbumin vaccine (aLA breast cancer vaccine) to treat patients with non-metastatic triple negative breast cancer, participants who are of cancer-free but may be at risk for triple-negative breast cancer, and for participants who are receiving adjuvant pembrolizumab following initial triple negative breast cancer treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, phase I dose-escalation trial that will be performed on three successive cohorts. The first cohort is comprised of participants with high-risk triple-negative breast cancer. The second is made up of participants scheduled to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomy due to their genetic risk of triple-negative breast cancer. The third cohort is comprised of participants who have had treatment for their triple-negative breast cancer treatment, receiving adjuvant pembrolizumab. These cohorts will be treated with successively higher doses of \u03b1-lactalbumin and zymosan.\n\nThis aLA breast cancer vaccine is an investigational (experimental) drug that the study team believes will work by stimulating the immune system to fight the participant's cancer, in a way similar to the way the immune system fights off an infection after a vaccination for that infection. \u03b1-lactalbumin Vaccine is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nA traditional \"3+3\" Phase I trial design will be employed for the cohorts to determined the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). After identification of the MTD, if at least 1 participant has an immunologic response (correlative measurement), successively lower dose levels will be expanded to a total of 6 participants and immunologic response assessed. Enrollment will stop if a dose level is reached for which no responses are observed. Dose-Limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 2 or more of 6 participants, the next lower dose will be considered the new MTD.\n\nObjectives are to determine MTD, DLT incidence, and Lowest Immunologic Dose (LID) for each cohort.\n\nToxicity will be assessed every 2 weeks until day 56 and at day 84 or at off-study. Participants will be offered participation in long-term follow-up involving contact or in-person follow-up for late toxicity and survival every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for an additional 3 years, and then annually for 10 years."
