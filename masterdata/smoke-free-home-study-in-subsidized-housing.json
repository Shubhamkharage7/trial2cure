This study fills this gap by identifying approaches to increase the implementation of smoke-free policies in all types of subsidized housing by increasing the voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes and promoting access to smoking cessation services.",
            "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nThe investigators will build on previous studies, where a smoke-free home intervention to increase voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes in permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless adults was developed and evaluated.\n\nAim 1: To estimate the effect of our adapted smoke-free home intervention on the primary outcome of residents' voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes and the secondary outcome of biochemically-verified tobacco abstinence at 6-months follow-up.\n\nAim 2: To determine the cost of our adapted smoke-free home intervention and determine whether it is a cost-effective use of health care resources.\n\nAim 3: To evaluate variation in stakeholders' perspectives on the adapted smoke-free home intervention's adaptability, scalability and sustainability.The proposed intervention can expand access to smoke-free policies and smoking cessation services in subsidized housing, thereby reducing racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco use, tobacco exposure and chronic disease in these populations.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nA wait-list cluster randomized controlled trial of the adapted smoke-free home intervention compared to usual care among residents from subsidized housing sites in Northern California. Participants from twenty-four subsidized housing sites will be randomized into intervention and waitlist control arms"

The study staff will qualitatively assess participants' knowledge by prompting questions on the topics covered and will refer participants to lay-health workers (LHWs) for one-on-one coaching.
