            "briefSummary": "This research study involves the study of TriPRIL CAR T Cells for treating people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and to understand the side effects when treated with TriPRIL CAR T Cells.\n\nThis research study involves the study drugs:.\n\n* TriPRIL CAR T Cells\n* Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide: Standardly used chemotherapy drugs as part of lymphodepleting process",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a two-part, non-randomized, open label, single-site Phase 1 study of TriPRIL CAR T Cells as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nThis study consists of 2 parts:\n\n* Part A (Dose Escalation) : The investigators are looking to find the highest dose of the study intervention that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated Once determined, this highest dose will then be used in the dose expansion part of the study.\n* Part B (Expansion Cohort):Participants will be treated at the respective dose as determined during Part A (Dose Escalation).\n\nTriPRIL CAR T Cells is an investigational treatment that uses a person's own immune cells, called T cells, to try to kill their cancerous cells. T cells fight infections and can also kill cancer cells in some cases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved TriPRIL CAR T Cells as a treatment for any disease.This is the first time that TriPRIL CAR T Cells will be given to humans.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive one infusion of the study treatment and will be followed for up to 2 years.\n\nIt is expected that about 18 people will take part in this research study."
