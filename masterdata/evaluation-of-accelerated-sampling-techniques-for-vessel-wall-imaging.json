This faster MR image technique will image participants blood vessel walls in a shorter period of time and will be compared to the routine MR images that is typically used to image participants blood vessel walls.\n\nThe purpose of testing these faster images is to compare the image quality with longer conventional images. The goal is to ensure the investigators maintain high image quality over a shorter period of time. These faster images over a shorter period of time have the advantage of fewer motion-related artifacts.\n\nThe hypothesis of this research study is that the compressed sensing (fast acquisition technique) based acquisitions will considerably reduce the scan time and will maintain the diagnostic image quality necessary for the assessment of participants blood vessel walls. Thus, the information gained from this study will help us to determine the efficacy of the accelerated protocols for vessel wall imaging."
