            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn if intranasal theophylline (CYR-064) improves sense of smell in participants with hyposmia or anosmia related to the onset of Parkinson's Disease. Fifteen adults, age 19-80, years will participate for about 32 weeks. They will use the study nasal spray for 24 weeks. The nasal spray is given as 2 sprays to each side of the nose twice per day. They will be seen every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, followed by monthly in-person visits. Tests about memory, Parkinson's Disease symptoms, and ability to detect and identify smells will be completed. Participants are monitored for any side effects.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm study that will investigate the use of intranasal theophylline (CYR-064) for the treatment of hyposmia and anosmia related to the onset of Parkinson's disease. The study drug of CYR-064, self-administered for a 24-week Treatment Period, is intended to improve the sense of smell in participants with persistent hyposmia and anosmia related to the onset of Parkinson's Disease. The study population will include approximately 15 adult participants between the ages of 19 to 80 years with moderate to severe hyposmia or anosmia caused by the onset of Parkinson's Disease. Eligible participants who meet all study criteria and have consented to participation will receive the investigational new drug (CYR-064) with a dose strength of 1120ug/day administered for 24 weeks. During the 24-week Treatment Period, participants will be asked to complete a weekly paper Diary with two questions to monitor compliance to the study drug.\n\nParticipants will be prompted and instructed to provide responses to 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) smell and taste symptom assessments on a scale of 0-10 (10 indicating normal senses), starting with the baseline visit and then weekly throughout the duration of the study via paper diary. Participants will return to the clinic every 2 weeks for the first month of the Treatment Period, followed by monthly in-clinic visits thereafter for the assessment of safety and efficacy of CYR-064 at 8, 12, 16 and 24 weeks.\n\nAt baseline and week 24, patients will be given the Sniffin Sticks threshold, discrimination, and identification (TDI) test.\n\nAt baseline and week 24, patients will be given the global impression of smell loss severity (PGI-SLS), smell loss change (PGI-SLC), global impression of loss of ability to taste food (PGI-TS), and change in ability to taste food (PGI-TC) questions. (note: each of these constitutes one multiple choice question).\n\nAt baseline and week 24, patients will be given the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts I and III, the Craft Story Recall, the Benson Complex Figure Test, and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised.\n\nAll participants will have intra-nasal examination and nasal endoscopy performed at baseline and at 24 weeks to ensure no structural or pathological issues are present leading to hyposmia and for assessment of safety. Adverse events (AE) will be assessed through clinical symptom presentation, intra-nasal examination, and endoscopy.\n\nAt each monthly in-clinic visit, participants will return the vials with the study drug (full or empty) and receive new vials for use during the following study period. Week 24/end of study (EOS) will serve as the last visit for all patients who complete the study, followed by a 30-day follow-up. Participants who discontinue treatment or study at any time will return to the clinic for the EOS visit. At Week 28 (\u00b1 7 days), a follow-up phone call to assess final safety and efficacy will conclude the participant's participation in the study."
