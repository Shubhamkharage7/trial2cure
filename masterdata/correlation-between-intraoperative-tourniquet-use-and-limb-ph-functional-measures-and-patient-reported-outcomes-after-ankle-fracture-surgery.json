            "detailedDescription": "Tourniquets are widely accepted as \"safe\" for up to two hours of continued use, despite known risks and a paucity of literature supporting this duration. Complications of tourniquets include tourniquet site pain, increased surgical site pain and swelling from reperfusion, neuropraxia, vascular injury, functional weakness, and decreased muscle endurance. Similar to compartment syndrome, tourniquets eliminate the tissue perfusion gradient necessary for oxygen, glucose, and lactic acid exchange. Lack of molecular exchange within the tissue is thought to result in tissue anoxia and acidosis, leading to cellular death of skeletal muscle and nerves. This study randomizes patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery to tourniquet or no-tourniquet arms and studies outcomes including continuous intramuscular pH during and after surgery, and patient-reported outcomes and functional measures up to 3 months postoperatively."
