            "detailedDescription": "\\<Study purpose\\> The purpose of this single arm interventional study is to evaluate initial safety and device design concept of HyperQureTM, laparoscopic(extravascular) renal denervation therapy, in patients with resistant hypertension on 3 or more antihypertensive medications including a diuretic The results of this study will be used to 1) prove the concept of complete ablation by Extravascular RDN and 2) develop a solid reference for a pivotal study\n\n\\<Background and Hypothesis\\> The HyperQureTM RDN System is developed to overcome the limitations of intravascular RDN using catheters; 1)incomplete renal denervation, 2) risk of endothelial damage due to heat transfer from inside blood vessels by intravascular access, and 3) access limitations due to vascular anatomy and vessel size.\n\nThe HyperQureTM RDN System is accessed through the vascular adventitia where renal sympathetic nerves are mainly distributed by retroperitoneal laparoscopic(extravascular) approach . Since the energy is transmitted from outside of vessel by wrapping the blood vessel 360 degrees and the instrument is applicable to small vessels including branch and/or accessory vessels, it is expected that it will be possible to achieve more complete renal denervation, reduce the risk of endothelial damage, and resolve structural access limitations.\n\n\\<Study plan\\> Fifteen eligible adult men and women with resistant hypertension will be enrolled and will have Extravascular(laparoscopic) RDN under general anesthesia and will have 36month follow up with various BP evaluations(24hABP, Office BP and Home BP) and CTA/DUS imaging scan evaluations"
