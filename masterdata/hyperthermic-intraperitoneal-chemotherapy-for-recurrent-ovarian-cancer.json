Eligible patients consenting to this protocol will undergo their scheduled surgical procedure. After surgical cytoreduction to a residual disease \u2264 2.5 mm, a single dose of carboplatin (800 mg/m2) will be administered in normal saline via intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion using the closed-abdomen. HIPEC will be continued for 90 minutes in the hyperthermic phase (41\u00b0C-43\u00b0C). At 4-6 weeks after CRS, patients will go on to receive 6 cycles of standard IV platinum-based chemotherapy. The proportion of patients who are without evidence of recurrence will be assessed at 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the day of surgery.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a phase I prospective study with the primary objective to compare the efficacy and safety of CRS and HIPEC. The target population for this study is patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers undergoing secondary CRS after the first platinum-sensitive recurrence. 'Platinum-sensitive' recurrence is defined as recurrence 6 months after the completion of the primary platinum-based chemotherapy. Carboplatin, delivered as HIPEC, will be administered at the time of surgery. Subjects will receive a single cycle of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Patients will then go on to receive standard platinum-based combination doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel, carboplatin and gemcitabine, or carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin) for 6 cycles.\n\nEligible patients consenting to this protocol will undergo their scheduled surgical procedure. After surgical cytoreduction to a residual disease \u2264 2.5 mm, a single dose of carboplatin (800 mg/m2) will be administered in normal saline via intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion using the closed-abdomen technique (43). HIPEC will be continued for 90 minutes in the hyperthermic phase (41\u00b0C-43\u00b0C). At 4-6 weeks after CRS, patients will go on to receive 6 cycles of standard IV platinum-based chemotherapy. Surveillance CT Chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast and serum CA-125 levels will be obtained at 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the day of surgery. Recurrence-free survival will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 guideline (version 1.1)."
