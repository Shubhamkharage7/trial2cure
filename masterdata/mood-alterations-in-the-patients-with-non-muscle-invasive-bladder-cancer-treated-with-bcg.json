Patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer receiving intravesical treatments are eligible to participate in this study. Participation involves providing research blood and urine samples prior to the start of treatment and throughout the treatment course. The study team will also collect participant's medical history and clinical information. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and daily mood diaries.",

Participants will be asked to complete the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale prior to each induction intravesical treatment. During the 6-week induction intravesical treatment, participants will also be given a daily mood dairy to complete. Urine Specimens will be collected prior to each induction intravesical treatment and at each 3-month cystoscopy appointment during the treatment course. An at home urine collection may occur 6 hours post intravesical treatment. Research Blood Samples will be collected prior to the first induction intravesical treatment, prior to the fourth intravesical treatment, and prior to each 3-month follow-up cystoscopy as indicated by the participant's treatment course. Participants will be asked to complete the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale prior to each 3-month follow-up cystoscopy during the treatment course. A 3-week daily mood diary will be completed by participants during the 3-week intravesical maintenance treatment. Participants will be given a daily mood diary to complete between the 3-month follow-up cystoscopy appointments."
