            "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, single-center, unblinded, pilot treatment study to evaluate pembrolizumab with or without lenvatinib as neoadjuvant therapy for RCC planned for surgical nephrectomy. Study objectives include the assessment of immunologic and histologic response measures following neoadjuvant therapy and their association with post-operative clinical outcomes. This trial will generate preliminary data on immune pharmacodynamic outcomes and tumor response for neoadjuvant pembrolizumab +/- lenvatinib and is not powered for comparison between the arms. Up to 33 participants will be enrolled to ensure 30 evaluable patients. Patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy and undergo nephrectomy are considered evaluable. The study will consist of 5 phases: 1) Study Screening; 2) Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy; 3) Surgical Resection; 4) Adjuvant Systemic Pembrolizumab Therapy; and 5) Post-Treatment Follow-up. The total study participant duration, including participant follow-up across all 4 study phases, will be approximately 60 months."
