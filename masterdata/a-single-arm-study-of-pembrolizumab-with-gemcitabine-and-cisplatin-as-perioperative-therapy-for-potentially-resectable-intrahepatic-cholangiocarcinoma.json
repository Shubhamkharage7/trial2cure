The effects of pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because gemcitabine and cisplatin used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. (Refer to Pregnancy Assessment Policy MD Anderson Institutional Policy # CLN1114).

Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n    * Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of treatment administration.\n15.
