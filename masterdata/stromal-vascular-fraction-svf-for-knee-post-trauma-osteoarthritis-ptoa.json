            "detailedDescription": "Clinical treatment generally involves a life-long combination of exercise, lifestyle modifications, and/or analgesics. If pain becomes debilitating, different surgical options exist, including arthroscopic joint debridement and mechanical axis change through osteotomies around the knee and eventually joint replacement surgery for severe cases to improve the quality of life. However, patients under 40 years of age, who expect to continue an active lifestyle, have only a 40% \"good or excellent\" function score after total knee replacement, they are most likely to outlive their initial replacement and need revision."
