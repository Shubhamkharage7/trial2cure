            "briefSummary": "Spinal cord injury following posterior decompression in patients suffering from chronic, cervicothoracic spinal cord compression is a known complication with multiple etiologies. Currently, intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) remains the gold standard for predicting and preventing post-operative deficits from these procedures. However, there is a paucity in the field of spine surgery for further, non-invasive biomarkers that can help detect and prognosticate the degree of spinal cord injury intraoperatively. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a radiation free imaging modality that utilizes nanobubble technology to allow for visualization of the macro- and microvascular architecture of soft tissue structures. Despite being currently approved for the use in hepatology and cardiology, it has remained absent from the field of spinal cord injury. The study team aims to evaluate and quantify micro- and macrovascular changes that lead to areas of hyper-perfusion as well as areas of ischemia intraoperatively in patients that undergo elective cervicothoracic posterior decompression for chronic compression. In addition, the study team aims to assess the efficacy of CEUS in detecting microvascular changes that correlate with IONM changes and predicting degree and recovery of post-operative neurologic deficits from intraoperative spinal cord injury. The study team hypothesizes that following decompression, subjects will have detectable levels of microvascular changes causing areas of hypoperfusion and reperfusion injury. Second, the study team hypothesizes that these perfusion changes will correlate with intraoperative neuromonitoring changes and can predict and prognosticate the degree of post-operative neurologic injury."
