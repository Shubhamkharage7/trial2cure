            "briefSummary": "This preliminary study is designed to evaluate mechanisms by which excitatory dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (vs. sham) and pharmacological stress (vs. placebo) alter behavior in non-treatment seeking individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Specific Aims are to (1) Evaluate how stress impacts domains of behavior including (1a) executive function and (1b) opioid-seeking behavior; and (2) Determine whether rTMS stimulation attenuates (2a) executive dysfunction, (2b) stress-reactivity, and (2c) opioid-seeking in individuals with OUD not receiving treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will use a double-blind, 10Hz left dlPFC rTMS (vs. sham) and pharmacological stressor (\\[yohimbine + hydrocortisone\\] vs. placebo) within-subject, randomized crossover design. Each participant will complete 4 sessions (stressor vs. placebo, crossed with rTMS vs. sham), each separated by at least 1 week. Participants will complete these 4 (2x2 within subject) test conditions in randomized order: sham rTMS/placebo stress, sham rTMS/active stress, active rTMS/ placebo stress, and active rTMS/active stress.\n\nThe PI will perform randomization using a Latin Square and will assign participants to conditions and prepare medication (stressor or placebo) for each participant's sessions. The PI will keep others blinded and will not be involved in study assessments."
