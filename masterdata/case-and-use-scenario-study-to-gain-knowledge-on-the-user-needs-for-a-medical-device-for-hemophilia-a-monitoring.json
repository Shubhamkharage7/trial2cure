This parts aims to identify potential use scenarios of a point of care (POC) in vitro medical for patients with hemophilia A. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* How is coagulation lab testing for patients with hemophilia A currently organized?\n* What is the interest and what are desired alternatives of a POC in-vitro diagnostic medical device for patients with hemophilia A?\n\nPart two of the study consists of a use scenario study in which patients with hemophilia A and HCPs will evaluate two types of non-functional mock-ups of a POC in vitro medical device. The main goal of this part is to evaluate the usability of the current prototypes of the POC device."
