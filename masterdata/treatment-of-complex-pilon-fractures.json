Limited literature comparing ORIF and ankle fusion as a primary procedure exists. Particularly, no present literature exists examining the novel arthrodesis surgical technique utilized in this study in conjunction with Opal sensor gait analysis data. This study will serve as a pilot study and assess patient gait, degree of pain, functional outcome scores, development of post-traumatic arthritis and/or infection, need for secondary surgery, and return to work time."
