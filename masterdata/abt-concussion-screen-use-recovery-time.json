Study hypothesis 1 - There will be significant differences between the treatment and the control arms' mean recovery time (days). Study hypothesis 2 - The ST-restricted \\& exercise treatment arm will have a significantly shorter mean recovery time (days) compared with the other treatment arms and control arm.",
            "detailedDescription": "The investigators will randomize a sports related concussion (SRC) treatment protocol (n=313) of Children's Health Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine (Andrews) pediatric SRC patients (aged 12-17 years) to one of four treatment groups:1. Screen Time (ST) restricted group, 2.Exercise group, 3.ST restricted \\& exercise group, and Control \\[stretching only\\]) group. The treatments will occur for the first 72-hours following the first clinic appointment. The investigators will monitor treatment adherence and 24-hour movement behaviors over a 72-hour period using the ActiGraph GT9X Link and heart rate monitor; a state-of-the-art research grade wearable device that our research team has expertise in administering and analyzing in field-based studies."
