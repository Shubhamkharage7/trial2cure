Arm B which was previously added to the protocol, has been permanently halted per the safety monitoring committees' decision on the safety findings of this arm.\n\nThe primary purpose of Phase 1 (Dose expansion) of the study is to assess the doses studied under Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) Arm A and identify the recommended dose (RD) for further development.\n\nThe Phase 2 will start once the RD Phase 1 has been defined. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess the efficacy of Debio 0123 at the RD for further development in combination with TMZ, compared to the standard of care (SOC) in adult participants with GBM."
