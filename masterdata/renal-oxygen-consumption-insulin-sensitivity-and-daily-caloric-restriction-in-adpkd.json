            "detailedDescription": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most commonly inherited progressive kidney disease. Overweight and obese phenotypes have been associated with disease progression in early-stage ADPKD. Daily caloric restriction (DCR, 34% restriction per day from baseline weight maintenance requirements) may aid in weight loss and ultimately slow ADPKD disease progression. Weight loss via DCR may cause alterations in kidney oxidative metabolism and insulin sensitivity that can affect ADPKD disease progression. This study aims to assess kidney oxidative metabolism via 11C-acetate PET scan protocol and insulin sensitivity via hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp by leveraging an ongoing R01-funded trial (NCT04907799) in DCR (n=10) vs. control (n=10) groups at baseline (BSL) and 2 years. The study will utilize the clinical outcome measures performed in the parent trial to address the subsequent novel aims: Aim 1: Compare kidney oxidative metabolism and insulin sensitivity at BSL and 2 years in adults with ADPKD. Aim 2: Define the relations among changes in kidney oxidative metabolism, insulin sensitivity, total kidney volume, and weight over 2 years. Currently, it is unknown if weight loss via DCR modifies renal energy expenditure and substrate utilization."
