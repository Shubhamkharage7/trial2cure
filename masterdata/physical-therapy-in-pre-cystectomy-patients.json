The purpose of this study is to investigate whether consultation with a physical therapist and the development of a personally tailored exercise program in the pre-cystectomy period for patients with bladder cancer will result in reduced post-operative complications, morbidity, length of inpatient stay, improve readmission 30-day and 90-day and improve 90-day mortality. This study will be partially retrospective (pre-implementation of a physical therapy consultation order) and partially prospective."
