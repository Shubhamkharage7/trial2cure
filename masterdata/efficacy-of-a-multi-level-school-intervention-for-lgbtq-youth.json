The investigators goal will be achieved by completing three specific aims: 1) Determine participant-level efficacy of the intervention in an RCT with 24 schools (6-10 schools each year over 4 years); 2) Determine the school-wide intervention effects on (a) reporting of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes among all SGMA students and (b) perceptions of school climate (norms, attitudes, beliefs, bullying behaviors toward SGM youth, policies) among all students, and; 3) Examine factors that may affect intervention success (e.g., fidelity of implementation, barriers or facilitators to implementation, school or student characteristics) to prepare the intervention for future dissemination. This intervention has been tested in a previous, smaller, Feasibility study with 4 high schools."
