            "briefSummary": "This study evaluates if three dimensional (3D) surface images can be used instead of the standard computed tomography (CT) scans for treatment planning in electron radiation therapy. 3D scanning has previously been used by several groups to design patient-specific devices to be 3D printed, and as has shown excellent agreement with CT obtained surfaces. Using 3D surface imaging instead of x-ray based CT, benefits include: no ionizing radiation used to produce images, shorter time between patient consultation and treatment, and ability to produce and evaluate patient-specific devices for electron therapy earlier in the treatment planning process. This study may help researchers learn how 3D surface scanning may be used to produce a virtual CT image of patient surfaces, and accurately replace traditional planning CT for treatment planning of electron based radiation therapy.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Develop and benchmark the necessary software to convert a 3D scan to a virtual CT.\n\nII. Compare the spatial accuracy of virtual CTs from 3D scans to the planning CT.\n\nIII. Compare radiation treatment plans based on the virtual CTs from aim 2 to treatment plans based on the actual planning CTs.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo 3D surface scans on study. Patient's medical records are also reviewed on study."
