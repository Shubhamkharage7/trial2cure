Frequency and severity of treatment-related AEs Adverse events will be collected and assessed for relatedness to the device and the procedure as well as for severity. The Clavien-Dindo severity grading scale is a commonly used criteria in the urology community. An independent medical monitor will adjudicate all treatment-related events.\n2. Frequency and severity of all AEs All adverse events will be summarized and reported, regardless of relatedness to the device or procedure.\n3. Change from baseline in semen characteristics over time (semen sub-study only) Semen characteristics (concentration, count, motility) will be summarized at each follow-up, including change from baseline values. Reported values for each subject will represent an average of 2 samples collected at each timepoint. Summary statistics will be based on reported values for each subject at each timepoint.\n4. Proportion of subjects experiencing \u226550% decrease in sperm concentration from baseline The proportion of subjects experiencing \u226550% decrease in sperm concentration from baseline to 3, 6 and 12 months will be reported.\n\n   Ancillary Efficacy Endpoints:\n5. Improvement in IPSS over time The IPSS tool is the most commonly reported symptom score for obstructive urinary symptoms secondary to BPH. Average IPSS scores, absolute change from baseline, and percent change from baseline will be reported at each follow-up timepoint.\n6. Improvement in ICS male SF over time The International Continence Society (ICS) male short form (SF) has three domains to assess urinary symptoms; voiding symptoms (e.g., hesitancy, incomplete voiding, etc.), storage symptoms (e.g., frequency), and leakage symptoms. Average total scores and average scores for each domain, along with changes from baseline, will be reported at each follow-up timepoint.\n7. Improvement in Qmax over time Uroflowmetry represents an objective measure of relief of obstruction. Average peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) and change from baseline will be reported at each follow-up timepoint.\n8. Improvement in PVR over time Residual urine in the bladder due to incomplete emptying is an important clinical consideration in subjects with obstructive BPH. Average PVR and change from baseline will be reported at each follow-up timepoint.\n9. Freedom from repeat intervention (time-to-event) The proportion of subjects free from repeat surgical or endoscopic intervention for BPH will be reported over time utilizing the Kaplan-Meier method."
