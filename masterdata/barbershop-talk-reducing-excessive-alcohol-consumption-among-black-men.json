This project seeks to test the effectiveness of a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention for use within barbershop settings to reduce average drinking days and the number of unhealthy drinking days. Data from this study will further our understanding of how to reduce the risk of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality among Black men. Data will also improve our understanding of strategies that can improve the implementation of evidence-based care models in non-clinical settings; thus, extending the reach of evidence-based care to communities with the highest need."
