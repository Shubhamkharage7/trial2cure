            "briefSummary": "This is a dose ranging exploratory phase 1 pilot study to assess engraftment, safety, and efficacy of CP101, an oral microbiome therapeutic, in participants with active mild-to-moderate Ulcerative colitis. A total of 30 patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to either a short or extended induction dosing with CP101. An assessment of the microbiome will occur at baseline, Day 6, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24.",
            "detailedDescription": "This dose ranging exploratory phase 1 pilot study will assess engraftment, safety, and efficacy of CP101, an oral microbiome therapeutic, in participants with active mild-to-moderate UC.\n\nParticipants with mild-moderate disease, defined as a complete Mayo score of \u22654 to \u22649 will be eligible for enrollment. Eligible participants must have an endoscopic and\n\nhistologically confirmed diagnosis of mild-to-moderate UC. Participants must have active disease at endoscopy (Mayo endoscopic score\\<=1) performed during screening.\n\nParticipants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to either initial induction only or initial and extended induction dosing with CP101. Both arms will receive an initial induction dose of CP101 comprising 10 capsules daily for 5 days. Participants will then either receive extended induction with a daily dosing of five CP101 capsules through Week 8 or matching placebo. Both participants and PI will be blinded to treatment arm allocation.\n\nParticipants will be assessed through Week 8 for the primary outcome, engraftment. Safety outcomes (all AEs and safety laboratory values) will be assessed through the 8 week treatment period. In addition, secondary efficacy outcomes of disease remission and response will be evaluated at Week 8. Participants will also be followed through Week 24 for long-term safety, engraftment, and clinical outcomes (including but not limited to remission and response). AEs will be recorded from informed consent through Week 24 trial visit. Blood samples for safety laboratory analysis, as well as blood and stool samples for biomarker assessments will be collected at scheduled trial visits per the Schedule of Assessments.\n\nThe primary outcome, engraftment of CP101 associated microbes will be measured utilizing two baseline samples (prior to CP101 administration) and the participant's Week 8 stool sample following Randomization. Additional stool sample collections for microbiome assessment will occur at Day 6, Week 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24.\n\nParticipants that experience on-study worsening of their UC or a severe flare requiring the administration of rescue therapy, will be withdrawn from the study but not replaced. They will be considered treatment failures and last values collected will be carried forward.\n\nThis study will prospectively enroll approximately 30 adult participants at a single center."
