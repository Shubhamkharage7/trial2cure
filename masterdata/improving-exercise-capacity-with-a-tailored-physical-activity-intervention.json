These workshops are intended to provide information on topics such as proper nutrition, management of stress, sleep practices, and emphasis on a healthy lifestyle that may help the participants through cancer treatment. This pathway will also test whether stretching may help participants through cancer treatment.\n* Second pathway participants will take part in some unsupervised and some potentially supervised moderate activity sessions each week throughout participants' cancer treatment to take place either remotely or in person, depending on availability of facilities at the time visits are scheduled.",
