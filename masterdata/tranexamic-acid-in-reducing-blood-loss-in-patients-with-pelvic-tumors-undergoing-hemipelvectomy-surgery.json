To determine if the use of tranexamic acid results in a significant reduction in intraoperative and perioperative blood loss.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if use of tranexamic acid lowers the amount of blood products transfused in hemipelvectomy surgeries and during first postoperative week.\n\nII. To determine if the use of tranexamic acid has an effect on laboratory (lab) measurements preoperatively through postoperative day 7.\n\nIII. To determine if use of tranexamic acid has an effect on complication, length of intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stays.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (TRANEXAMIC ACID): Patients receive tranexamic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes 30 minutes prior to surgery and continuously during hemipelvectomy procedure in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II (NO TRANEXAMIC ACID): Patients undergo standard of care hemipelvectomy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days."
