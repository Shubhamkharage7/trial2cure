Our hypothesis is that RC+GEM will: 1) reduce hemoglobin A1c as much or more, 2) require less diabetes medication, 3) cost less, and 4) have more secondary benefits, (e.g. greater reduction in cardiovascular risk, weight, diabetes distress, depression symptoms), compared to RC alone.",
            "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will compare individualized self-administered versions of RC+GEM to RC among patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that, compared to RC alone, RC+GEM will be at least as effective at improving blood glucose control (A1c), and RC+GEM will do so with less reliance on diabetes medication and with greater secondary benefits such as lower risk of cardiovascular disease, more \"good\" cholesterol (HDL), greater weight loss, a greater sense of empowerment, and fewer diabetes-related expenses. It is further hypothesized that these benefits will be sustained over 13.5-months of follow-up with no structured maintenance program."
