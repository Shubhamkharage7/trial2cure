            "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to characterize the immune response, both innate and adaptive, as well as locally and systemic, to intradermal (ID) vaccination in healthy individuals. The intervention involves intradermal administration of an FDA-approved intramuscular seasonal influenza vaccine, using an FDA-approved device MicronJet. Investigators will measure antibody titers, cell subtypes, and multi-omic profiles, by collecting skin and peripheral blood at baseline and at several time points after vaccination. The primary objective is to identify baseline correlates of immune response in the skin and peripheral blood to the seasonal influenza vaccine. The investigators secondary goals are to describe the inflammatory response in the skin over time.",
            "detailedDescription": "Subjects will remain on study and may optionally repeat study visits (including vaccination) annually through the 2025-26 influenza season, with final study follow-up up to 1 year after vaccination. Sampling individual subjects across several influenza seasons will allow for monitoring of multi-season responses.\n\nSkin, blood, nasal mucosal lining fluid, and skin microbe samples will be collected at various timepoints before and up to 365 days after vaccination to explore short and long-term effects of immunization. Subjects may optionally provide stool samples."

An IM-control group of N=5 will be kept for each flu season; Therefore the total number of participants will be 249 participants. We will not include saline controls in subsequent seasons.\n\nParticipants in saline-control cohorts will be restricted from obtaining flu vaccination until after Day 28; after Day 28, they will be allowed to receive influenza vaccination at their discretion. We will ask and record if and when they received vaccination.",
