Mindfulness interventions such as guided meditation may improve pain control and decrease stress. Including a brief mindfulness intervention administered via test messages as part of postoperative care may improve pain severity, decrease opioid use, and improve patient responses to non-surgical treatments.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate and define anticipated and unanticipated adverse events (AEs) related to a daily virtual mindfulness intervention delivered via short message service (SMS) text messaging and to test its safety in the postoperative period amongst patients with cancer.\n\nII. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, brief mindfulness intervention delivered via SMS text messaging in the postoperative period amongst patients undergoing surgery for cancer.\n\nIII. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an artificial intelligence platform to deliver and receive SMS text messages for the purpose of delivering pain assessment tools and collecting and storing pain-specific and patient reported outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients complete pain survey via text message daily for 10 days after surgery. Patients also complete telephone interview 2 weeks after surgery.\n\nARM II: Patients complete mindfulness intervention via text message daily for 10 days after surgery. Patients also complete telephone interview 2 weeks after surgery."
