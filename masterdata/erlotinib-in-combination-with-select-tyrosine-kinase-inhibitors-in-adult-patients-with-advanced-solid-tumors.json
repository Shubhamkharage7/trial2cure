            "briefSummary": "Cancers that return or spread after their first line of treatment are often difficult to treat with limited next step options. Based on preclinical studies, the EGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Erlotinib may be better in stopping or slowing the growth of tumors when given in combination with the multitargeting TKI Lenvatinib or Axitinib. Participants will be screened with a physical exam and tests including urine and blood tests, imaging scans, and a test of their heart function. Erlotinib, axitinib, and lenvatinib are all capsules taken by mouth. All participants will take their drugs at home every day. Some participants will take erlotinib plus lenvatinib once a day. Some participants will take erlotinib once a day and axitinib twice a day. Assignment to one of the treatment arms will be determined by the study. Participants will record their doses in a diary. Treatment is given in 28-day cycles. All participants will have 4 clinic visits during their first treatment cycle. After that, they will have a clinic visit at the start of each new cycle. Imaging scans, blood and urine tests, and other tests will be repeated during various clinic visits. Participants will remain in the study for as long as the treatment is helping them. They will have follow-up phone calls after they stop treatment....",

Dose escalation on both arms will follow a 3 plus 3 design, with intrapatient dose escalation permitted.\n* Assignment to one of the treatment arms will be determined by the study.\n* The study will allow accrual of patients to backfill cohorts, in which patients will be enrolled on the most recently cleared dose level when accrual to the current dose level has been completed per 3 plus 3 design, but the DLT monitoring period has yet to be completed at that dose level. Dose-limiting toxicities will be defined during the first cycle of treatment.\n* The accrual ceiling will be set at 70 patients."
