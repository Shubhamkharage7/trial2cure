These patients often die with distressing symptoms and may receive more invasive, life-prolonging treatment than they would choose for themselves. Moreover, their family members acting as surrogate decision makers often experience lasting psychological distress from the ICU experience. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial among 500 patients and 750 surrogates and up to 1250 clinicians to determine whether early integration of specialty palliative care with standard critical care can improve outcomes for critically ill older patients at high risk of death or severe functional impairments and their family members."
