            "briefSummary": "Paclitaxel is among the most active agents against glioblastoma in preclinical models. However, its clinical use has been hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this trial we will implant a novel device with 9 ultrasound emitters allowing to temporarily and reversibly open the BBB immediately prior to chemotherapy infusion with albumin-bound paclitaxel.\n\nIn the phase 1 component, increasing doses of chemotherapy will be delivered as long deemed safe based on the prior patient not experiencing severe toxicity. Once the the recommended dosing has been established, carboplatin will be added to the regimen and additional patients will be treated in order to better evaluate the antitumor efficacy of this novel treatment.\n\nThe device will be implanted at the time of surgical resection of the recurrent tumor. During that procedure and when feasible, a first test dose of the chemotherapy will be administered in the operating room after sonication (procedure of activating ultrasound and opening the BBB) and tissue concentrations in different parts of the resected tumor will be measured. In select patients, the sonication procedure may occur immediately after the test dose of chemotherapy is administered.\n\nThe objectives of this trial are to establish a safe and effective dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel, to demonstrate that the opening of the BBB increases chemotherapy concentration in the tumor, and to estimate how effective this treatment is in reducing the tumor burden and prolonging life.",
            "detailedDescription": "Eligible patients will undergo craniotomy for tumor resection. During the tumor resection and when possible, an initial low dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel will be given following sonication. In select patients, the sonication procedure may occur immediately after the test dose of chemotherapy is administered. The sonication device will be implanted at the end of the procedure. In phase 1, about two weeks after surgery, patients will undergo sonication and albumin-bound paclitaxel administration with MRI to quantify extent of blood brain barrier opening. Sonication and administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel will continue every 3 weeks until disease progression. The planned albumin-bound paclitaxel starting dose is 40 mg/m2, to be escalated in the absence of significant toxicity up to 260 mg/m2. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA will also be collected before and after each sonication. In phase 2, pre-sonication carboplatin at AUC 5 will be added to the regimen, with a safety run-in for the first 6 patients."
