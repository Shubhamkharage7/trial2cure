            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effects of different exercises programs in individuals with abnormal knee motion. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* In individuals with abnormal knee motion and without knee pain, does a weight-bearing exercise program reduce abnormal knee motion during a step-down test better than a non weight-bearing exercise program? Participants will\n* Perform a stepdown test while undergoing motion analysis and electromyograph (EMG) recording.\n* Participants will then be placed either into a weight-bearing or non weight-bearing exercise group. Exercises will be performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks.\n* Further motion analysis and EMG data will be collected to test for differences. Researchers will compare individual results before and after exercise, and between-group results before and after exercise to see if one exercise program helps improved abnormal knee motion more than the other.",
            "detailedDescription": "The goals of this trial is to compare the effects of a closed kinetic chain exercise program to an open kinetic chain exercise program in individuals without knee pain who also have dynamic knee valgus during a step-down test.\n\nIndividuals will be screened for participation via visual observation. Those with an observable medial collapse of the knee joint will then receive motion capture testing of the step down test (three trials) with electromyography recording of the gluteus medius, quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups. Baseline maximum voluntary contraction of these muscles will be done with EMG analysis and force gauge measurements.\n\nAfter initial data collection participants will be randomized into either a closed kinetic chain exercise group or open kinetic chain exercise group. (described in the Arms section) Participants will exercise 2-3 times per week for 6 weeks. After the exercise program is completed, participants will then be seen back for final data collection which will match the initial collection process."
