            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test a new way of measuring the peripheral vision (called a visual field test) using a device which can be worn as goggles rather than being a large instrument the patient must sit at. This new visual field test (called VisuALL) is an FDA-approved virtual reality system which has been used in adults and children. This study will compare the performance of the VisuALL to the standard testing for peripheral vision, which is called the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) test.\n\nThe study will recruit both healthy children, as well children and young adults who have eye conditions which require visual field testing as part of their standard care. The test will be performed on a day when the child or young adult already has a scheduled eye appointment as standard care. The test does not touch the eyes or require any eye drops to be given, and there is no known risk associated with the test itself. There may be a risk of loss of confidentiality. Participating in this study will require approximately 30 minutes, has no extra cost associated with it, and will be compensated by a parking pass for the day of the visit. There are no direct benefits for participants.\n\nSelected participants will be also be given training and then loaned a home VisuALL system to allow home visual field testing. If your child is selected, additional information would be provided."
