Subject with skin ulcer lesions of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa meet the following criteria, on the screening start day (Visit 1) and treatment start day (enrollment day) (Visit 3):\n\n   1. Subject has two skin ulcer lesions judged as comparable to compare the safety and efficacy by investigator during screening period and prior to the IP application (enrollment day).\n   2. Two skin ulcer lesions meeting criteria stated in 2a) should be sized 5-20 cm2 (inclusive)\n3. Subject who has two comparable target skin ulcer lesions, and each lesions with a change of size equal to or less than \u00b150% at treatment day (Visit 3) compared to that of screening day (Visit 1)\n4.
