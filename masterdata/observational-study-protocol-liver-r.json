            "briefSummary": "Given the number of anticipated durvalumab-based treatment launches in the hepatobiliary cancer space over the next 3 years, there is a need to capture contemporary real-world data across these indications. LIVER-R is a multicountry, multicenter, observational study of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hepatobiliary cancer treated with a durvalumab-based regimen as part of routine clinical practice or early access program (EAP). The study design will include primary and secondary data collection. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of durvalumab-based regimens in real-world settings as measured by real-world overall survival. Other endpoints include demographics, clinical characteristics, clinically significant events of interest, treatment patterns, concomitant medications, and other real-world clinical endpoints (such as duration of treatment, progression-free survival, time to treatment progression, time to next treatment, recurrence-free survival, and time to treatment recurrence).",
            "detailedDescription": "LIVER-R is a real-world, multi-country, multi-centre study aiming to enroll approximately 2500 pts with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC; n=1135) or advanced biliary tract cancers (aBTCs; n=1355) across 22 countries from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. The study design will include primary and secondary data collection. Primary data will be collected in real-time during the patient's routine visit. Secondary data will be collected from the patient's medical record at enrollment and at prespecified study time points (6-month intervals). The study population includes adult patients whose physician has previously made the decision to treat them with a durvalumab-based regimen for hepatobiliary cancer as part of routine clinical practice or patients receiving treatment through EAP. The study will include a baseline period of up to 5 years before the index date (initiation of a Durvalumab-based regimen) and a follow-up period to the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal, or end of study for a maximum follow-up of 2 years for patients with aBTCs or 3 years for patients with uHCC. This is a descriptive, noncomparative study. No formal hypotheses are to be tested. All descriptive analyses will be conducted separately for each primary hepatobiliary cancer indication. Kaplan Meier estimates will be produced for time-to-event outcomes."
