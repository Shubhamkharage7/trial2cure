During the treatment period, participants will have scheduled visits to the trial center at Cycle 1 day 1(C1D1), C1D2, C1D8, C1D15, and C1D16, followed by Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 7, and Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter.\n\nApproximately 60 to 80 participants could be enrolled in this trial, including approximately 24 to 36 participants in Part 1 (dose escalation), including optional backfill cohorts, and approximately 40 participants in Part 2 (randomized dose expansion).\n\nAll participants will receive active trial intervention.\n\nUp to 4 dose-level cohorts may be evaluated in Part 1; at least 2 dose levels may be evaluated in Part 2."
