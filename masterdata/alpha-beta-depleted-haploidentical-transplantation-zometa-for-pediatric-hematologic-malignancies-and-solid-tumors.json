            "detailedDescription": "CONDITIONING REGIMENS: Patients with high-risk leukemia will receive myeloablative conditioning with anti-thymocyte globulin intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days -12 through -9, Fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 through -5, Thiotepa IV every every 12 hours on day -4 and Total Body Irradiation (TBI) on days -3 through -1. All other patients receive reduced intensity conditioning consisting of anti-thymocyte globulin intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days -12 through -9, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 through -5, thiotepa IV over 4 hours every 12 hours on day -4, and melphalan IV on days -3 and -2.\n\nPERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TCR-alpha/beta+ and CD19+ depleted KIR/KIR ligand-mismatched haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. If the graft contains less than 4 x 10\\^6 CD34+ cells/kg, a second HSC graft may be administered.\n\nPROPHYLAXIS FOR GVHD: Patients receiving a graft containing \\> 25 x 10\\^3 CD3+ TCR alpha/beta+ cells receive mycophenolate mofetil IV twice daily over 2 hours on days 1 to 30 with a rapid taper. Patients with TCR alpha/beta+ cells exceeding 100,000/kg also receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally (PO) every 12 hours on days 0-90 with a taper at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.\n\nZOLEDRONATE ADMINISTRATION: Patients will receive five doses of Zoledronate (IV) at 28 day intervals beginning on Day +28 post-HSCT.\n\nFollow-up assessments will occur after transplantation."
