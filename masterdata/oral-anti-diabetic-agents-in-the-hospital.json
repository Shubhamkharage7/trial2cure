            "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled clinical trial will assess whether continuation of home oral antidiabetic agents during hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to insulin therapy in the management of diabetes in the hospital. The primary outcome of the study is to determine differences in glycemic control as measured by mean daily blood glucose concentration between oral antidiabetic medications and basal bolus therapy in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).",
            "detailedDescription": "Hyperglycemia in the hospital is common and has been associated with increased hospital complications, length of stay, and mortality. Improving glycemic control has been shown to improve length of stay, multi-organ failure, systemic infections, as well as short- and long-term mortality. Clinical guidelines from professional organizations recommend the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical patients with T2D. This approach, however, is labor intensive requiring multiple daily insulin injections, costly, and associated with significant risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia\n\nOver 75% of patients with T2D are treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) but due to the lack of safety and efficacy data from randomized controlled trials, clinical guidelines recommend stopping OADs during hospitalization. The current clinical guidelines have raised concerns with the use of OADs including risk of hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas, fluid retention and worsening of heart failure with thiazolidinediones, and risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with severe renal impairment. However, several observational studies have reported that the use of OADs results in similar glycemic control without increased risk of complications compared to insulin regimens. A recent observational study that included 17,325 hospitalized patients with T2D, found that patients treated with OADs had similar glycemic control without differences in complications and no increase in rates of hypoglycemia compared to those treated with insulin.\n\nThis study will assess whether continuation of home oral antidiabetic agents during hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to insulin therapy in the management of diabetes in hospital patients with T2D. For a subset of participants (50 patients per group), a CGM devise will be placed for the duration of the study to assess parameters of glycemic control and hypoglycemia."
