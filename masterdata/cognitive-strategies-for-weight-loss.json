The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Which of the three Internet-delivered weight loss programs results in the greatest weight loss?\n* How do key weight-related behaviors (e.g., adherence, diet, physical activity) differ across the arms?\n* What individual characteristics predict success in each arm?\n* What are the underlying mechanisms of each approach?\n* Are there any potential adverse outcomes associated with any of the conditions (e.g., depression, weight stigmatization, increased body image concerns).\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* signed informed consent\n* complete a baseline assessment\n* be randomized to 12 months of either Standard iBWL, PREVENT or PROMOTE\n* complete a training workshop to learn arm-specific cognitive strategies\n* complete a 12-month Internet-delivered weight loss program, requiring self-monitoring of intake and exercise and viewing of 12 weekly lessons followed by 9 monthly lessons\n* complete an assessment at 3 months (during treatment)\n* complete a refresher workshop on arm-specific cognitive strategies at 3 months\n* complete an assessment at 6 months (during treatment), 12 months (at the conclusion of treatment), and 18 months (6 months after treatment"

This monitor uses a validated triaxial accelerometer and proprietary data filtering technology to estimate free-living PA and sedentary behaviors. Accelerometer data will be processed and analyzed using Actigraph's ActiLife software. Data will be considered valid if the monitor was worn for more than 10 hours on more than 4 days (including one or more weekend day). Intensity will be assessed as average counts per minute (cpm) and previously validated cut points (Freedson et al., 1998) will be used to identify bout-related moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (greater than or equal to 1952 cpm accumulated in bouts greater than or equal to 10 min) and sedentary time (less than 100 cpm).",

A trained interviewer will collect recalls using Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDSR 2018; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota). NDSR uses a multipass method which provides participants multiple opportunities to recall each consumed food/beverage and reduces reporting biases. Given issues with use of dietary recalls to determine absolute energy intake, NDSR output will be used to examine changes in energy density and diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index, 2015 (HEI-2015).
