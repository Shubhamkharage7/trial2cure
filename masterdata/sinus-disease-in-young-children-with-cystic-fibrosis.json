This study involves two groups: children 2-8 years old, inclusive at initial visit, receiving highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT), and a control group of children 2-8 years old, inclusive at initial visit, not receiving HEMT. Outcomes will include sinus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, olfactory tests, and quality of life surveys obtained over a two-year period.",
            "detailedDescription": "This multi-center, prospective, observational study investigates the effects of highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and olfactory dysfunction (OD) in young children with cystic fibrosis (YCwCF). The study spans two years and includes two distinct groups of children with cystic fibrosis: children \u2264 8 years old receiving HEMT and a control group of children \u2264 8 not receiving HEMT. The study aims to assess the efficacy of HEMT in improving sinus health and olfactory capabilities in this young demographic.\n\nKey assessments include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sinus opacification, olfactory bulb volume measured via MRI, objective olfactory testing, and various quality (QOL) surveys. This investigation seeks to characterize the severity of CRS and OD in YCwCF, and to elucidate if early initiation of HEMT improves CRS and OD .\n\nIn the HEMT group, participants will have a pre-HEMT assessment followed by 1-year and 2-year post-HEMT evaluations. In the control/non-HEMT group, participants will undergo parallel assessments at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year intervals to track the natural progression of CRS and OD without HEMT."
