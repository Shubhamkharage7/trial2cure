This study will use Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to optimize the intervention's effectiveness for smoking cessation among Veteran smokers with chronic pain.",
            "detailedDescription": "Veterans with chronic pain represent an important population in which to focus smoking cessation efforts. Smoking cessation among patients with chronic medical illnesses substantially decreases morbidity and mortality; yet, many patients (\\>50%) with chronic pain continue to smoke.\n\nThis study aims to:\n\n1. Determine whether the existing integrated pain and smoking cessation (PASS intervention) augmented with IVR (PASS-IVR) is superior to treatment as usual (e.g., referral to standard VA smoking cessation clinic) enhanced with pharmacotherapy tele-consult (E-TAU) at 6 (primary endpoint) and 12 months on cigarette abstinence rates among non-depressed Veterans with chronic pain.\n2. Determine whether PASS-IVR is superior to E-TAU at 6 (primary endpoint) and 12 months on pain interference.\n3. Examine critical components of the intervention process to inform future program implementation."
