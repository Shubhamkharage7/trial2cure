The two methods of sampling are: 1) Using forceps that take biopsies (small tissue samples) from your esophagus, and 2) Using a brush that also takes biopsies from your esophagus.",
            "detailedDescription": "This study will look at the impact of the brush biopsy results on your doctor's decisions about your future care and treatment.\n\nIn addition , by recording the results of all your biopsies over 5 years, it may be possible to find out if the brush biopsy, forceps biopsy, or both can predict which patients with heartburn develop Barrett's esophagus, (an abnormality in the esophagus that may lead to cancer), and which patients with Barrett's esophagus develop precancer and cancer.\n\nYou are being asked to participate in the study because you are receiving an upper endoscopy (a procedure where a tube with a light and camera are inserted in your mouth and down your throat) with forceps and brush biopsies of your esophagus as part of you standard clinical care, and you are at least 18 years old."
