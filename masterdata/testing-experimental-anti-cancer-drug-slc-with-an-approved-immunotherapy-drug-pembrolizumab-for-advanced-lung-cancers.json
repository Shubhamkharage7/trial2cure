Participants will swallow SLC-391 pills two times every day. Participants will get pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.\n\nThis study has 2 parts. The first part will determine the recommended dose of SLC-391 in combination with pembrolizumab. The second part wants to find out if the combination of SLC-391 and pembrolizumab can help stop NSCLC tumours from growing or spreading."

Examples include, but are not limited to, active uncontrolled infection (including tuberculosis \\[TB\\]) requiring systemic therapy, transfusion dependent anemia, recent (within 90 days) stroke or myocardial infarction, unstable angina, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class \u2265 III/IV), and recent severe COVID-19.\n\nNote: TB testing is required for subjects recently exposed to persons with active TB or who have traveled recently to areas where TB is endemic.\n\n* Systolic blood pressure (BP) \u2265 160 mmHg or diastolic BP \u2265100 mmHg.\n* Has a corrected QT interval (QTcF) \u2265 470 msec. Note: Apply the Fridericia QT correction to calculate QTcF using the following formula: QTcF = QT/RR1/3 where QT = the time between the start of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave and RR = the time between the start of one QRS complex and the start of the next QRS complex.\n\nNote: If a subject has a prolonged QT interval and the prolongation is deemed to be due to a pacemaker as deemed by the Investigator (i.e., the subject otherwise has no cardiac abnormalities), the subject may be eligible to participate in the study following discussion with the Sponsor.\n\n* History or presence of sustained or symptomatic bradycardia (\u2264 55 bpm), left bundle branch block, ventricular arrhythmia excluding premature ventricular contractions, or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia. Subjects with a supraventricular arrhythmia requiring medical treatment and a normal ventricular rate are eligible.\n* Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions including known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that could interfere with the subject's ability to provide informed consent, comply with the protocol, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results.\n* Inability to swallow oral medication and/or the presence of active gastrointestinal (GI) disease and/or other GI conditions, including bowel resection, that is expected to interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of oral SLC-391 therapy.\n* Received radiation therapy to the lung that is \\> 30 Gy within 6 months of the first dose of study drug(s).\n* Had an allogenic tissue, marrow, or solid organ transplant.\n* Females who are pregnant or nursing. Note: SLC reserves the right to deny any subject enrollment based upon potential safety concern(s) or factors that could confound the study results.\n\nNote: The Investigator or licensed, medically qualified Sub-Investigator must review and confirm eligibility prior to the first dose of study drug(s).",
