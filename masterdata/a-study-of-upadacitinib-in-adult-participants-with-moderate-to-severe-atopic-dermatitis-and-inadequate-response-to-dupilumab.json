            "briefSummary": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin condition that may cause a rash and itching due to inflammation of the skin. Therapies spread over the skin may not be enough to control the AD in trial participants who require systemic anti-inflammatory treatment. This study aims to provide data on the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib at different doses in adult participants with moderate to severe AD.\n\nUpadacitinib is an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). This study is conducted in 2 periods. During Period 1, participants are randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups called treatment arms to receive upadacitinib Dose A or dupilumab Dose A. Based on the participants response to upadacitinib Dose A, they may have their dose increased to upadacitinib Dose B after 2 weeks. In Period 2, participants that completed Period 1 will either remain on their assigned dose or be reassigned to a different dose based on their Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) response. Approximately 300 adult participants ages 18 to 64 with moderate to severe AD who are current users of dupilumab and had a history of inadequate response to dupilumab will be enrolled at up to 94 sites worldwide.\n\nThe study is comprised of a 35-day Screening Period, an 8-week Open-Label Period 1 and a 24-week Open-Label Period 2 for participants that completed Period 1. Participants will receive upadacitinib oral tablets once daily or dupilumab subcutaneous (SC) injection every other week for 32 weeks and followed for 30 days.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."
