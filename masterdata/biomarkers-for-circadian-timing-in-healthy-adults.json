The study is designed to assess the levels of different biomarkers in the blood taken from frequent samples across three separate sleep-wake conditions - Conventional/Normal sleep-wake conditions (baseline), extended wake/acute sleep deprivation (constant routine), and during irregular sleep-wake conditions (inverted day). Participants will be asked to complete medical, psychological, and sleep-wake evaluations prior to the study. Upon completion of screening, if eligible, participants will stay 7 consecutive days and nights in the sleep research laboratory within the hospital."
