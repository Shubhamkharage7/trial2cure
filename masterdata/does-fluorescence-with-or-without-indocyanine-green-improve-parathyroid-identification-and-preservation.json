            "detailedDescription": "The accurate identification of the parathyroid gland is a crucial aspect of thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Failing to recognize the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy can result in the inadvertent removal of the gland, leading to postoperative hypocalcemia. On the other hand, during parathyroidectomy, there is a risk of mistaking other structures, such as lymph nodes, for parathyroid adenomas, which can leave the patient without a cure. Currently UAB employs intraoperative PTH or radioactive isotope techniques in conjunction with surgeon judgment. However, both methods have limitations, including being time-consuming, posing logistical challenges, and not providing feedback before gland removal.\n\nParathyroid fluorescence is a relatively new technology. It was initially discovered that the parathyroid gland emits fluorescence, which distinguishes it from the surrounding tissues. Additionally, indocyanine green dye is readily taken up by the parathyroid gland, making its detection easy to the naked eye. Research has demonstrated that parathyroid fluorescence, with or without indocyanine green, is not only safe but also helps reduce postoperative hypocalcemia and locate lesions in patients with imaging-negative parathyroid adenomas. However, the current use of parathyroid fluorescence is not standardized, and further studies are needed to explore its clinical utility in terms of cure rates and postoperative complications."
