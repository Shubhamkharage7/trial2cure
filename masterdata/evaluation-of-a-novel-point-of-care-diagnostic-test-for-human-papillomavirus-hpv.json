To evaluate the performance of 3 versions of a novel point-of-care diagnostic test for detecting HPV (\"Rice HPV test\").\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n1. To evaluate the results of the Rice HPV test with corresponding pathology results to assess the association of HPV test results with the presence of high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 2+).\n2. To assess how different sample processing methods affect the performance of the Rice HPV test.\n3. To assess how different test readout methods affect the performance of the Rice HPV test.\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\n1. Compare the performance of the Rice HPV test between provider-collected and self-collected samples.\n2. Conduct a survey on participant experiences with self-sampling to assess whether participants prefer self-sampling over provider-collected sampling.\n3. Compare the performance of the Rice HPV test to other benchmark HPV tests such as GeneXpert."
