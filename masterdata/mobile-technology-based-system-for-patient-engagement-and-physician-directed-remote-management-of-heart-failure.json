High-value, guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) for heart failure can reduce mortality and improve quality of life. However, large gaps in treatment with GDMT persist. While prior quality improvement efforts have focused on heart failure hospitalizations, there is a critical need to improve the quality-of-care post-discharge when the initiation and up-titration of GDMT is critical to optimizing outcomes. The main purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, preliminary utility and acceptance of a digital technology-based system for heart failure management."
