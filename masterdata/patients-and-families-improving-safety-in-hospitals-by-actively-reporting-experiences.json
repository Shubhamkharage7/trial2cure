            "briefSummary": "Hospitals ineffectively examine the safety of their processes by relying on voluntary incident reporting (VIR) by clinical staff who are overworked and afraid to report. VIR captures only 1-10% of events, excludes patients and families, and underdetects events in vulnerable groups like patients with language barriers. Patients and families are vigilant partners in care who are adept at identifying errors and AEs. Failing to actively include patients and families in safety reporting and instead relying on flawed VIR presents an important missed opportunity to improve safety. To improve hospital safety, there is a critical need to coproduce (create in partnership with families) effective systems to identify uncaptured errors. Without this information, hospitals are impeded in their ability to improve patient safety.\n\nIn partnership with diverse families, nurses, physicians, and hospital leaders, investigators created a multicomponent communication intervention to engage families of hospitalized children in safety reporting. The intervention includes 3 elements: (1) a Spanish and English mobile (email, text, and QR-code) reporting tool prompting families to share concerns and suggestions about safety, (2) family/staff education, and (3) a process for sharing family reports with the unit and hospital so systemic issues can be addressed. After piloting the intervention in one inpatient unit, marked improvements in family safety reporting and reductions in disparities in reporting by parent education and language results. The investigators now propose to conduct an RCT of the intervention in 4 geographically, ethnically, and linguistically diverse hospitals. The specific aims are to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in improving error detection and other safety outcomes, (2) assess the impact of the intervention on disparities in reporting, and (3) understand contextual factors contributing to successful implementation of the intervention. If effective, the intervention will contribute by: (1) increasing patient/family engagement in reporting, especially from vulnerable groups, (2) identifying otherwise unrecognized events, and (3) enabling hospitals to better understand safety problems in a 360-degree manner and design more effective, patient-centered solutions."
