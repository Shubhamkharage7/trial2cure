            "briefSummary": "With modern therapy, the survival rate for pediatric brain tumor patients has significantly improved, with over 70% of patients surviving their disease. However, this progress often comes at the cost of substantial morbidity, with cognitive deficits being the primary obstacle to independent living. Robust predictors of cognitive decline and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cognitive injury remain elusive. This study will prospectively investigate alterations in brain resting state networks following radiation therapy using functional imaging. The hypothesis is that radiation therapy leads to dose-dependent alterations in functional connectivity in the networks associated with higher level cognition, ultimately leading to cognitive decline."
