            "detailedDescription": "The investigators have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity, called Regulation of Cues (ROC), which is based on Behavioral Susceptibility Theory. The ROC program targets two theorized mechanisms for overeating; decreased sensitivity to appetitive cues and increased sensitivity to external food cues. Considering that FBT has merit for some children, but not all, this study will compare ROC to FBT, ROC with nutrition education and reducing energy intake (ROC+), and Health Education (HE). Treatment will consist of weekly individual sessions for the first 16 sessions, then twice per month for the final 2 months for a total of 20 sessions. The investigators will recruit children ages 7-12 with overweight or obesity who are high in food responsiveness (FR) and their parent and will conduct assessments at baseline, post-treatment (month 6), 6-month follow-up (month 12) and 12-month follow-up (month 18)."
