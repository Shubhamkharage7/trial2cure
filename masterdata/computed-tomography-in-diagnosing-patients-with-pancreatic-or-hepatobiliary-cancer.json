To prospectively validate our pilot data that indicate that pre-therapy computed tomography-based (CT) mass transport properties correlate with overall survival.\n\nII. To prospectively validate our pilot data that indicate that local control of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors correlate with changes in computed tomography-based mass transport properties of the tumors after cytotoxic therapies.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo CT scan at baseline and after 4 to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/irinotecan/leucovorin calcium/oxaliplatin, or after 4 infusions of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (or other gemcitabine-based regimens), or 6 to 12 weeks after radiotherapy for hepatobiliary cancers. Patients may undergo optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans prior to therapy, after two weeks of therapy, and at the time of the first restaging CT scan."
