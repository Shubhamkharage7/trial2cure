            "detailedDescription": "Cancer survivors (i.e., those who completed cancer-directed treatment) often experience long-term treatment-related effects, such as cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD). Exercise and cognitive rehabilitation (rehab) interventions have been shown to improve CRCD symptoms in both cancer and non-cancer populations. Among older adults without cancer, studies have also demonstrated that multicomponent interventions combining exercise and cognitive rehab are more effective in improving cognitive dysfunction than either intervention alone. However, exercise adherence and self-efficacy are lower in older adults compared to younger adults, and combined interventions may be too demanding for older cancer survivors. Therefore, innovative ways are needed to integrate an exercise program within the context of a cognitive rehab program to increase exercise adherence and self-efficacy, and ultimately improve CRCD symptoms through a streamlined multicomponent intervention.\n\nIn this study, the investigators propose to refine a multicomponent Exercise and COgnitive rehab intervention (E-Co) and assess its feasibility in older cancer survivors."

Geriatric Oncology-Exercise for Cancer Patients (GO-EXCAP) leverages a mobile app to deliver an individually tailored, low-to-moderate intensity, home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program designed for patients with cancer, tailored to their physical capacity.
