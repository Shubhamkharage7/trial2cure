            "briefSummary": "TITRE - Trial of Indication-based Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in ECMO, is a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial. The overarching goal of TITRE is to determine whether restricting red blood cell (RBC) transfusion according to an indication-based strategy for those with bleeding and/or deficit of tissue oxygen delivery, compared with transfusion based on center-specific hemoglobin or hematocrit thresholds, can reduce organ dysfunction and improve later neurodevelopment in critically ill children receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support.",
            "detailedDescription": "Observational studies of children on ECMO have shown an association between large-volume RBC transfusion and mortality. However, the hematocrit (or hemoglobin) level at which optimal tissue oxygen delivery occurs is unknown. TITRE - Trial of Indication-based Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in ECMO, is a prospective, randomized clinical trial to be conducted at 18-20 study sites. The overarching goal of TITRE is to determine whether restricting RBC transfusion according to an indication-based strategy for those with bleeding and/or deficit of tissue oxygen delivery, compared with transfusion based on center-specific hemoglobin or hematocrit thresholds, can reduce organ dysfunction and improve later neurodevelopment in critically ill children receiving ECMO support.\n\nAim 1: To test whether children \\< 6 years of age on ECMO support who are randomized to a strategy of indication-based versus center-specific threshold-based RBC transfusion will have greater improvement in organ function.\n\nAim 2: To test whether survivors among children age \\< 6 years on ECMO support who are randomized to indication-based compared to center-specific threshold-based RBC transfusion will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes and health-related QOL at one year post-randomization.\n\nKey design features include: Randomization stratified by patient age (neonate:\n\n=\\< 28d vs. non-neonate) and by diagnosis (CHD vs. other diagnosis); and a target sample size of 228 patients. Endpoints will be evaluated during ECMO, at hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. To ensure trial integrity, the primary outcome (pSOFA: Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) will be adjudicated by an independent committee and neurodevelopmental assessments will be blinded."
