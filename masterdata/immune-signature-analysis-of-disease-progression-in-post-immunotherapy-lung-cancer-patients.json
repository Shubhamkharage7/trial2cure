            "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, non-randomized, pilot study. The target population is adults \u226518 years of age with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that at immunotherapy discontinuation, have completed at least 20 of an anticipated 24 months of planned doses of pembrolizumab in the first line setting. The study will be conducted at various LCI locations and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center. Subjects will have blood for ctDNA and immune markers collected at baseline, and every 3 months for up to approximately 6 months. Blood will be collected at disease progression if it occurs prior to 6 months, ensuring that the collection occurs prior to start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. We will also collect data from standard of care CT scans every 3 months for up to 6 months or until disease progression. In patients undergoing standard of care biopsies, a portion of tumor tissue will be obtained and tested for tumor mutations. Archived tumor tissue collected pre-immunotherapy (if available) will also be tested."
