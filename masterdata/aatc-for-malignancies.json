Patients must have histologic or cytologic verification of recurrence at relapse. No additional biopsy is required for patients with primary refractory diseases. The pathology report for the diagnosis under which the patient is being enrolled and associated molecular diagnostic reports must be submitted.\n* CD30 Expression Status : Disease specific histologic, cytologic, or Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-confirmed CD30 cell surface expression on malignant cells is required.\n* Disease Status:\n\n  i. Lymphomas: Patients must have measurable disease for assessment of radiographic response defined as either nodal disease \\>/=1.5 cm or extranodal lesion \\>/=1.0 cm.\n\nii. Leukemias: Patients must have relapsed/refractory (including MRD \\>0.01% by flow cytometry) disease.\n\n* Prior Therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer chemotherapy, defined as resolution of all such toxicities to \u2264 Grade 2 or lower per the inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to entering this study\n* Age: Patients must be \u2265 18 years at time of study enrollment.\n* Life Expectancy: Life expectance of \\>12 weeks.\n* Performance Status: Karnofsky \u226550% for patients. Note: Neurologic deficits in patients with CNS involvement must have been stable for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n* Organ Function Requirements: Have acceptable organ function\n* Pregnancy: It is not known what effects this treatment has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Non-sterilized female patients of reproductive age and male patients should use effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after study treatment.\n* Consent: Ability to under understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it. Voluntary written consent will be documented before initiation of study-related procedures not part of normal medical care. Consent may be withdrawn by the subject/guardian without prejudice to future medical care.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior Therapy: Any toxicities from prior treatment, \\>Grade 3 per CTCAE v5.0\n* Investigational Agent: Treatment with any investigational agent within 14 days of enrollment.\n* Exclusion Requirements Due to Comorbid Disease or Concurrent Illness:\n\nImmune: Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Steroid premedication for imaging scans is allowed. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n\nInfectious: Systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment). Patients with possible fungal infections must have had at least 2 weeks of appropriate anti-fungal antibiotics and be asymptomatic.\n\nPulmonary: No current or prior history of anti-CD30 therapy related pulmonary toxicity.\n\nNeurologic: No current or prior history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\nCardiac: Patients cannot be diagnosed with NYHA Class III or IV (Appendix 5) congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n* Allergies: Known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction attributed to any of the components of CD30 biAb-AATC or to compounds of similar composition to CD30 targeted agent, or a bispecific Antibody-armed activated autologous T cell product.\n* Pregnant or Breastfeeding: Pregnant or breastfeeding females will not be allowed to enroll on this study. Female patients with infants must agree not to breastfeed their infants during the entire study treatment period and through three months after the last study drug dose. Agents used in this study are known to be teratogenic to a fetus. There is there is no information on the excretion of CD30 biAb-AATC agents into breast milk but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with a CD30 biAb-AATC.\n* Secondary Malignancy: Patients should not have a history of any second malignancy in the last 1 year with exception of the diagnosis for inclusion; subjects with prior history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Subjects with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for at least 1 year.",
