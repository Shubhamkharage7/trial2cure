            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of CBT-NC intervention to determine its impact on mental health and suicidality in children ages 6-17. The main aims are:\n\nAim 1: Examine CBT-NC efficacy for improving nightmare distress and frequency in youth with chronic nightmares by comparing the treatment and waitlist group.\n\nAim 2: Examine whether improvements in nightmares relate to fewer mental health problems for youth by determining by comparing the treatment and waitlist group.",
            "detailedDescription": "Chronic nightmares in youth put them at risk for mental health problems including suicidal ideation and attempts. Left untreated, chronic childhood nightmares can persist, resulting in myriad mental health problems. An international consortium of nightmare experts urged the medical community to prevent mental health problems in youth through early detection and treatment of chronic nightmares. There are several well-established, brief, and cost-effective nightmare treatments for adults but research with youth is lagging. To date, several small case series have investigated nightmare treatments for youth and there is a need for clinical trials. The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Nightmares in Children (CBT-NC), a brief five-session manualized therapy designed to treat children ages 6-17. This randomized controlled trial with treatment and waitlist arms will assess the efficacy of the intervention and determine if the intervention has any impact on mental health problems and suicidality at follow-up.\n\nThis study will be the first randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of Cognitive behavioral therapy for nightmares in children (CBT-NC), compared to a waitlist group. Our goal is to determine whether CBT-NC can be an effective treatment strategy for reducing nightmares in youth, which are linked to suicidality.\n\nFirst, this study will address the need for efficacious and cost-effective treatment for improving nightmare distress and frequency in youth with chronic nightmares. Second, this study will determine if improvements in nightmares reduce risk for youth mental health problems including suicidal ideation."
