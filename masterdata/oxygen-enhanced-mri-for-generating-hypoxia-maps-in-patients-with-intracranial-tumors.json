            "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates the feasibility of performing oxygen-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to generate hypoxia maps in patients with intracranial tumors. Decreased levels of oxygen (hypoxia) is a hallmark of malignant brain tumors. Chronic hypoxia is a stimulator of blood vessel formation, which is required for tumor growth and spread. Hypoxia also limits the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy. MRI is an imaging technique that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. The administration of inhaled oxygen allows for an increased MRI signal effect size. Oxygen-enhanced MRI may be a non-invasive method that can physiologically estimate tissue hypoxia. With a better understanding of the extent of tumor hypoxia, more effective and patient-specific therapies could be devised to halt malignant tumor growth.",
