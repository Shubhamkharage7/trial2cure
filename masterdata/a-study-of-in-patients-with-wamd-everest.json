            "briefSummary": "In neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the macula, or the part of the eye that provides the clear, detailed central vision, is being affected by abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. This leakage affects the vision over time and can lead to severe blurriness or blinding. EXG102-031 was made to block the extra vessel formation which would lead to less leakage affecting the vision. Before EXG102-031 can be tested for its efficacy (if it makes vision better), it must be tested to see if it is safely tolerated to confirm it can continue to be studied in more patients with nAMD.",
            "detailedDescription": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults. The wet form of AMD, also called neovascular AMD (nAMD) usually causes faster vision loss than the dry form. The most common current treatments of nAMD are products that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (including ranibizumab (LUCENTIS\u00ae, Genentech) and aflibercept (EYLEA\u00ae, Regeneron) and are delivered by intravitreal injections at 4 to 16 week intervals and continued indefinitely. This Phase I, open-label, multiple-cohort, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EXG102-031 gene therapy in subjects with previously treated nAMD. Safety will be assessed over 52 weeks after the administration of EXG102-031, and study participants will be followed for a total of five years after they receive the investigational administration of EXG102-031."
