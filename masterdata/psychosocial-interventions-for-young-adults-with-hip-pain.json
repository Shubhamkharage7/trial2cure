            "briefSummary": "Psychosocial conditions are common in young adults with hip pain including depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and narcotic use. The incidence of these conditions is not well defined. Interventions to optimize psychosocial conditions with non-surgical or surgical treatments has not been investigated. The goal of this project is to determine the incidence of psychosocial conditions in the young adult population with hip pain and determine if cognitive based therapy can improve clinical outcomes in these individuals.",
            "detailedDescription": "Over the last 3 decades there has been a drastic increase in the number of joint preservation surgeries performed for pre-arthritic hip conditions in the United States. Despite advances in surgical technique and the understanding of the biomechanics of impingement and dysplasia, failure rates range from 5-20% at early follow up, and can be even higher with continued monitoring. These failures are often attributed to the presence of pre-operative osteoarthritis, increased age, or unaddressed structural deformity. The influence of psychosocial factors on surgical and rehabilitative outcomes has been recognized in multiple populations, but has largely been ignored in individuals with hip pathology, in spite of growing recognition by clinicians as to how psychosocial factors may contribute to patient outcomes. Previous investigations have demonstrated poor mental health is associated with pre-operative narcotic use and lower physical function. Further, the investigators have identified certain psychiatric diagnoses as independent factors associated with failure of hip arthroscopy. Addressing these often complex psychosocial issues using cognitive based therapy has been successful in improving outcomes across a range of medical conditions. Further investigation into the incidence of these psychosocial conditions, their contributions to surgical and non-surgical outcomes, and interventions for mental health optimization need to be performed in musculoskeletal medicine, specifically in the developing field of hip preservation surgery. The goal of this project is to (1) understand the burden of maladaptive psychosocial traits in young adult patients with hip pain, and (2) reduce pain, decrease narcotic use, and improve physical function through psychosocial intervention delivered concomitantly during physical therapy. The investigators seek to maximize outcomes of individuals with non-arthritic hip dysfunction by addressing maladaptive behaviors so subjects can more effectively participate in rehabilitative treatment, and potentially, avoid the need for surgical management."
