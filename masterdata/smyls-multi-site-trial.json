Specifically, the investigators propose to determine the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome of self-management behaviors and the secondary outcomes of quality of life, transition readiness, healthcare utilization, and pain interference. In addition, the investigators will explore how patient activation moderates development of self-management behaviors and systemic, structural, and social variables that moderate relationships between patient activation, the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes."
