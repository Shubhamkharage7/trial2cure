            "briefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PBF-1129 in combination with nivolumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has come back (recurrent) or spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as PBF-1129 and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of adenosine A2B receptor antagonist PBF-1129 (PBF-1129) and nivolumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based upon the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 criteria.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the efficacy of the combination of PBF-1129 and nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC, including progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To study the effect of PBF-1129 on the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and in peripheral blood of study patients.\n\nII. To evaluate correlative biomarkers that might predict disease response to treatment with PBF-1129 and nivolumab therapy in previously treated NSCLC patients including STK11 genetic alterations and a transcriptional signature of LKB1 functional status developed by the Carbone lab.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PBF-1129 given in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nPatients receive adenosine A2B receptor antagonist PBF-1129 (PBF-1129) orally (PO) once daily (QD) and nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 1 year."
