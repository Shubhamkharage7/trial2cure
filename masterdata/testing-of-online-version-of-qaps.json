            "briefSummary": "Early evaluation of prewriting skills is important, as prewriting skills set the stage for later learning of the fine motor and visual motor skills needed for writing. Evaluation of prewriting skills allows for the identification of those children who struggle with these tasks so that early intervention might address these foundational skills before academic demands become more challenging. However, current prewriting skill assessments are limited to pencil-and-paper assessments that require an evaluator to score the drawn shapes. Manual scoring is time consuming, can be subjective, and limit the ability to capture subtle changes in performance.\n\nWe have developed an assessment on a tablet to assess prewriting skills in children. The preliminary testing of the assessment is published in a paper (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35417278/). We are now working on developing an online version of the assessment that will allow offsite data collection and will automate the analysis on the website so that the results can be automatically generated for the clinician or educator who wants to use this with the children they work with."
