            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to see if the enhanced HMZ 2.0 intervention with new control system/digital platform to regulate gestational weight gain (GWG) and impact maternal-infant outcomes while collecting implementation data works and can be given to other pregnant women in various settings. The question this study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does the new intervention manage GWG?\n2. Does the new intervention have any influence on sleep and eating behaviors and infant outcomes.\n3. Does the new platform and other data collected help inform how well the research and information can be used in health care settings?\n\n144 pregnant women with overweight/obesity will be randomized to either the HMZ 2.0 intervention or attention control groups from \\~8-36 weeks gestation. All participants will be asked to:\n\n1. Weight themselves and wear an activity monitor each day over the study.\n2. Complete online surveys at either a weekly or monthly level about their thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors on GWG, physical activity, eating behaviors, sleep, their anxiety, depression, and stress.\n3. Attend weekly sessions with a registered dietician.\n\nThe weekly sessions will differ based on intervention group. The HMZ 2.0 intervention group will receive education, create and follow goal-setting and action plans, self-monitor their behaviors, and receive feature evidence and fetal growth facts. Education, goals, and self-monitoring will focus on GWG, physical activity, eating behaviors, sleep, self-regulating behaviors and emotions, and preparing for labor/delivery and postpartum.\n\nThe attention control group will receive weekly sessions on preparing for labor/delivery and benefits of behavioral pain management strategies (e.g., mindfulness-based relaxation, imagery, music, massage, deep-breathing) to help with pain after childbirth without medicine.",
            "detailedDescription": "Pre-intervention: Onsite procedures. Pregnant women with overweight/obesity enrolled in the study will be asked to complete assessments (\u22658 and \u226415 weeks gestation) at the Penn State Clinical Research Center (University Park or Hershey campus). A study staff member will describe the study and obtain consent. Women with any health issues will be asked to follow-up with their provider and/or given a referral as needed. Subjects will have access to REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-based application to complete online surveys for social cognitive outcomes for PA and EI (eating healthy/ limiting unhealthy foods), and sleep and eating behaviors. A staff member will answer questions and explain the free-living procedures. This visit will take \\~90 minutes.\n\nPre-intervention: Free-living procedures. A 10-day period will provide a grounding of each subject's baseline physical activity (including sedentary behavior), energy intake, social cognitive determinants, and sleep/eating behaviors for the individual energy balance model to predict GWG. Energy intake kcal will be estimated with the back-calculation method utilizing measured weight, physical activity, and resting metabolic rate (quadratic regression formula). There is not a set threshold of data compliance for back-calculating energy intake, the investigators will use strategies to reach similar compliance (\\>90%) as our feasibility trial and other studies that used a run-in phase. Only women with no weight or physical activity data during this period will be excluded. On the morning of each day of the 10-day free-living protocol, subjects will be asked to complete study measures. The investigators will prompt with daily reminders and follow-up with non-compliant women to resolve barriers/technology issues.\n\nMeasurement procedures over study period. Subjects will use mHealth tools for real-time data collection on our energy balance and behavior model constructs to predict GWG in the Control Optimization Trial and assess sleep/eating behaviors. Data collection will occur: daily for GWG and physical activity/sedentary behavior/sleep; weekly for physical activity/energy intake social cognitive determinants (online in REDCap), and on at least 2 weekdays/1 weekend for energy intake diet quality. Monthly measures of eating behaviors and psychosocial health will be assessed.\n\nPost-intervention assessments. Maternal GWG, physical activity, sedentary behavior, energy intake, social cognitive determinants, and sleep/eating behaviors will be obtained with the same mHealth devices/procedures as described above in the pre-intervention assessments. To reduce subject burden, there will be no onsite post-assessments.\n\nLabor and delivery data will be abstracted from the medical record with patient HIPAA authorization.\n\nRandomization. A staff member will request randomization after the pre-intervention measures by unique subject ID number. The study biostatistician, will develop the randomization scheme using variable-size, random permuted blocks to ensure number of subjects in each group is balanced after each set of B randomized subjects where B is block size. Randomization to control (n=72) and intervention (n=72) groups will use 1:1 allocation; subjects will be entered consecutively. Randomization will be stratified by pre-pregnancy BMI status (\\< 29.9 kg/m2 vs. \u2265 30 kg/m2). A staff member will call each woman to inform her of study assignment and schedule her for the first session (attention control or HMZ 2.0 intervention)."

It differentiates \"poor\" from \"good\" sleep by measuring seven areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The participant self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. Scores can range from 0-21. An overall sleep quality score greater than or equal to 5 reflects poor sleep quality. The outcome reported is overall sleep quality.",
