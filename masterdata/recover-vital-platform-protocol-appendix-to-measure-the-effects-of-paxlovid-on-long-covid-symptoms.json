This sub-study is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) in two dosing durations for the treatment of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC). The study is evaluating potential mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of antivirals and other therapeutics in individuals with PASC, according to the platform protocol objectives. The hypothesis is that persistent viral infection and/or overactive/chronic immune response and inflammation are underlying contributors to PASC and that antiviral and other applicable therapies may result in viral clearance or decreased inflammation and improvement in PASC symptoms.",
