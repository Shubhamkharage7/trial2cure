Once the safety of ISB 1442 is confirmed and a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is established in Phase 1 for a given indication, Phase 2 will be initiated for that indication.\n\nParticipants will receive ISB 1442, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the trial occurs."
