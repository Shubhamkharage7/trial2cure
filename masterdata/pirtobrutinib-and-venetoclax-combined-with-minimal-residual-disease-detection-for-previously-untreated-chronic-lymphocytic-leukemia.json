            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well pirtobrutinib and venetoclax work in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. This study also seeks to adopt a blood test which shows a small number of cancer cells in the body after cancer treatment called minimal residual disease as a guide to determine length of treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pirtobrutinib and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Identifying minimal residual disease results after combination chemotherapy may help guide future treatment decisions for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the rate of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) (uMRD, by ClonoSEQ) in both peripheral blood and bone marrow after 15 cycles of treatment.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess best peripheral blood uMRD rate and best bone marrow uMRD rate by ClonoSEQ.\n\nII. To assess progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate. IV. To assess duration of response (DOR), time to next treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS).\n\nV. To assess toxicities associated with pirtobrutinib and venetoclax.\n\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To analyze the dynamics of MRD (by ClonoSEQ) and its association with response to treatment and clinical outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pirtobrutinib orally (PO) daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle and venetoclax PO QD starting in cycle 4 on days 1-28 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 27 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans during screening and on study. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy and collection of blood samples throughout the study and collection of stool and saliva on study. Patients may undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan during screening.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients follow up at 30 days and every 6 months for up to 3 years for clinical follow-up and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after registration for survival follow-up."
