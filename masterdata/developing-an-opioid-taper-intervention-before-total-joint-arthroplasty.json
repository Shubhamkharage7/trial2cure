The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the intervention feasible and acceptable to patients?\n* Does the intervention result in a decrease in opioid dose during the preoperative period?\n\nParticipants will meet with a clinical pharmacist, who will provide some basic education on pain and opioids, and will propose an opioid taper schedule. The pharmacist will then follow-up with the participant by phone each week until surgery to assess progress and adjust the taper as necessary."
