            "briefSummary": "This study is researching an investigational drug called REGN7075 by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy. The study is focused on patients with certain solid tumors that are in an advanced stage. The aim of the study is to see how safe and tolerable REGN7075 is by itself and in combination with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy), and to find out what is the best dose of REGN7075 to be given to patients with advanced solid tumors when combined with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy). Another aim of the study is to see how effective REGN7075 by itself, or in combination with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy), is at treating cancer patients.\n\nThe study is also looking at:\n\n* Side effects that may be experienced by people taking REGN7075 by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy.\n* How REGN7075 works in the body by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy.\n* How much REGN7075 is present in your blood when given by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy.\n* To see if REGN7075 by itself and in combination with cemiplimab with or without chemotherapy works to treat your cancer by controlling the proliferation of tumor cells to shrink your tumor."
