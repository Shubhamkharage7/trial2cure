Patient will be either off stimulant medications or, if undergoing treatment with stimulants, will be asked to discontinue two days prior to the experiment, under physician-guided protocol, and allowed to resume afterwards. Subjects may resume stimulant use between the two study visits so long as they discontinue use two days prior to the second study visit. If fatigue is problematic in subjects discontinuing medication, they will be allowed to continue with the study if they are able to follow the suggested taper plan (50% of the dose day one, 25% dose day 2, stop day of visit (day 3)).\n4. English-speaking\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Current or past history of clinically unstable psychiatric conditions such as suicidal or homicidal behavior or psychotic disorders.\n2. Pregnant or nursing females.\n3. Inability to participate in testing procedures\n4. Contraindication to tDCS: history or epilepsy, metallic implants in the head and neck, brain stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, VP shunt, pacemakers, pregnancy.\n5.
