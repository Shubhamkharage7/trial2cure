            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine (called ARV-471) when given together with other medicines for the potential treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who have breast cancer that:\n\n* is advanced, may have spread to other organs (metastatic) and cannot be fully treated by surgery or radiation therapy\n* is sensitive to hormonal therapy (it is called estrogen receptor positive); and\n* is no longer responding to previous treatments\n\nThis study is divided into separate sub-studies.\n\nFor Sub-Study B:\n\nAll participants will receive ARV-471 and a medicine called ribociclib. ARV-471 and ribociclib will be given at the same time by mouth, at home, 1 time a day.\n\nThe experiences of people receiving the study medicine will be examined. This will help determine if the study medicine is safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will continue to take ARV-471 and ribociclib until their cancer is no longer responding, or side effects become too severe. They will have visits at the study clinic about every 4 weeks.",

The sub-study is part of Umbrella platform, TACTIVE-U, comprising multiple sub-studies that independently evaluate ARV-471 in participants with with Estrogen Receptor Positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (ER+/HER2-) Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer. ARV-471 will act as the backbone therapy given in combination with other anticancer agents thought to have clinical relevance in ER+ breast cancer."
