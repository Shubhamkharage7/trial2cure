Evaluate factors associated with access to genetic risk assessment, counseling, and testing services.\n2. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of interventions on improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC of genetic test results among individuals with a P/LP variant in an inherited cancer gene.\n3. Conduct a pilot study to assess the effectiveness of an intervention on improving FC of family cancer history among individuals with a VUS in an inherited cancer gene.\n4. Create and pilot an adaptive intervention to tailor resources to promote CRM and FC.\n5. Document and compare multiple implementation outcomes across the different interventions to maximize their effectiveness and improve reach to underserved populations."
