This study will utilize two groups - one group will receive the exercise and VR, while the other group will receive stretching exercise and VR over eight weeks. The study team will administer outcomes at baseline, post-intervention (8 weeks) and follow-up (6 weeks after post-assessment).",

Outcomes will include balance and gait measures, blood-based biomarkers, neuroplasticity measures (assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation), spinal reflex excitability (measured by H reflex) and quality of life."
