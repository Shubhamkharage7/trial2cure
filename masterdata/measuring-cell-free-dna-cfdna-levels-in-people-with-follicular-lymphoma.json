They will look at whether cfDNA levels are related to a person's response to the usual first-line treatment for follicular lymphoma. Researchers also want to understand how different genetic changes in follicular lymphoma relate to a person's response to the usual first-line treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a non-therapeutic protocol aimed to assess the ability of the s cfDNA assay to detect clinical response in FL when compared to conventional approaches for assessing response, such as PET-CT scans.\n\nStudy assessments will include: 1) identification of the mutations present in the primary tumor, 2) identification of these mutations in the peripheral blood samples collected before initiation of standard therapy, after 2 cycles of therapy, at the completion of 6-8 cycles of induction therapy, and then every 6 months for a total of 2 years from the initiation of therapy using a cfDNA assay. For patients who receive RT, peripheral blood samples will be collected before initiation of RT, and then 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months post RT using a s cfDNA assay."
