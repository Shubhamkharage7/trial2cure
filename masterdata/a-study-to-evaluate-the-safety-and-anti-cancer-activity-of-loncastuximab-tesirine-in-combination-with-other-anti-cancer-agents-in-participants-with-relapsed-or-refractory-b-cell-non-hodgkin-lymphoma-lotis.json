            "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with polatuzumab vedotin, glofitamab, or mosunetuzumab, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) for the combinations.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, open-label, multi-arm study to evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with polatuzumab vedotin, glofitamab, or mosunetuzumab in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (R/R B-NHL). The study will enroll approximately 200 participants.\n\nLoncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402; Zynlonta) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) conjugated through a cathepsin-cleavable linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. Loncastuximab tesirine has been granted by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as accelerated approval for adult participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL). In the European Union (EU), the European Commission (EC) granted conditional approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and HGBCL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\n\nThe study includes multiple arms in two parts, Dose Escalation part (Part 1) and Dose Expansion part (Part 2). In Part 1, for the arm of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with polatuzumab vedotin includes DLBCL, HGBCL, follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL); for the arms of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with glofitamab or mosunetuzumab include DLBCL, HGBCL, FL, and MZL. In Part 2, participants will be treated at the dose level determined from Part 1. The Sponsor will conduct the safety monitoring and the overall supervision of the study in consultation with the Dose-Escalation Steering Committee (DESC).\n\nFor each participant, the study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of 21 days), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to two years). Participants may continue treatment for up to one year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first.\n\nTreatment with gemcitabine (Arm A), lenalidomide (Arm B), and umbralisib (Arm D) were removed."
