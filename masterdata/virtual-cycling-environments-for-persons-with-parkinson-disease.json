Does the use of virtual reality increase the intensity and and enjoyment of the experience compared to bicycling without virtual reality? 2. Does the way in which the bicycling (interval compared to continous) is performed affect the experience? 3. How does the way the virtual reality is delivered (with goggles or projected on a screen) affect the experience?",
            "detailedDescription": "Participants attend two sessions. They complete movement assessments and questionnaires about physical activity. During the first session they bicycle in a semi-immersive (projected on a screen) and an immersive (with googles) virtual environment. After each bout they completed a questionnaire about the experience. In the second session they bicycle four times with and without a virtual environment using both a continous and interval mode. Their oxygen consumption is measured during cycling. They complete questionnaires after each exercise bout."
