Using new cutting-edge computational methods, the investigators have found that small groups of senescent cells in fibroids work in concert with immune cells to produce soluble factors in fibroid tissues to create a feed-forward loop leading to fibrosis. This project seeks to unravel key cell-cell communication networks involving senescent and immune cells in fibroids to develop new treatments for uterine fibroids."
