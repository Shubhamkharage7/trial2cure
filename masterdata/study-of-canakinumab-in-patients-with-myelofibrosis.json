Eligible patients will receive Canakinumab administered as a subcutaneous injection on day 1 of a 21 day cycle for a core study period of 8 cycles. Canakinumab will be given by subcutaneous injection (SC) injection at a starting dose of 200 mg (one 150 mg/mL syringe and one 50 mg/0.5 mL syringe) every 3 weeks. The interim analysis will be performed when the number of enrolled patients reaches 10. If no responses OR 4 or more patients have unacceptable toxicity, the study will not proceed to the second stage. If the total number of patients reaches the maximum sample size of 26, the treatment is deemed acceptable if the number of responses in the efficacy endpoint are greater than 3, and the number of toxicities are less than 7."
