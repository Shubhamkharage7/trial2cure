            "briefSummary": "The overarching goal of this study is to develop a direct-to-patient screening approach that will improve early Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) detection in patients with psoriasis. Previously developed screening questionnaires were intended for use in the setting of a doctor's office to assist providers with referral decisions. However, these screening questionnaires are infrequently used in routine practice because of limitations with time and resources. The study will aim to develop a practical screening strategy that does not require involvement from dermatologists (or other non-rheumatology providers) and can systematically reach a broad range of psoriasis patients, including patients not attending dermatology clinics. The researchers hypothesize that disseminating questionnaires directly to patients outside of a clinic setting (direct-to-patient approach) will educate patients about their PsA risk and improve early PsA diagnoses.",
            "detailedDescription": "Electronic medical record (EMR) systems will be used to identify psoriasis patients without a PsA diagnosis. Patients will be randomized to receive a PsA screening questionnaire (intervention group) or not receive a questionnaire (control group). Rates of rheumatologic evaluations and new PsA diagnoses will be compared between the groups, using EMRs to longitudinally track outcomes.\n\nIntervention group patients who through the completion of the PsA Screening questionnaire positively self-screen for an elevated PsA risk will either be randomly invited to directly access a rheumatology appointment or instructed to talk with their doctor about a rheumatology referral. We will compare rates of rheumatologic evaluations and new PsA diagnoses between these groups to identify the best method for accessing rheumatology appointments.\n\nTo determine if PsA patients diagnosed after receiving a screening questionnaire differ from patients diagnosed via usual care; investigators will examine disease duration, severity, and comorbidities in patients receiving and not receiving the screening questionnaire."
