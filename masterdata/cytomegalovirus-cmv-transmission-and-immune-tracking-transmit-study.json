Participants will complete a health survey and provide one saliva sample for CMV PCR testing. In addition, infrastructure for the study will be developed (e.g. community engagement to build the network of centers, data pipelines, digital platform, sampling workflows) and participant sample collection at home will be piloted. These activities will inform the design of STAGE II."
