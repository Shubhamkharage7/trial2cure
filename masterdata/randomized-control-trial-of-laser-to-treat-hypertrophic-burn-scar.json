            "briefSummary": "Laser treatment of hypertrophic burn scars has become increasingly popular for improving scarring in burn survivors. Despite its common use, there a gap in knowledge regrading randomized control trials that demonstrate whether the laser is beneficial. Such a trial is important because if it shows the laser does work, it would provide the evidence to make such treatments more accessible to all patients.\n\nFurthermore, there is no knowledge whether the burn injury used to remove tissue is beneficial or not. This study aims to evaluate the laser treatment, removal of similar tissue amounts with 0.5mm punch biopsies, to controls to fill this knowledge gap.\n\nThe hypothesis is the laser is beneficial at improving patient's burn scars. Also the punch biopsies work better at improving scars by removing tissue without burning and injuring the surrounding tissue as the laser does.\n\nTo evaluate these treatments (laser, punch biopsies, and no treatment), 3 small areas will be chosen in a study scar area that meets specific criteria to receive . Patients will still be able to receive laser and burn reconstruction procedures in all other areas not involving the study scar area that are clinically indicated.\n\nIn the study, the scar will be evaluated with photographs, surveys, and tissue samples taken either while under anesthesia except for one set taken with numbing medicine. The tissue samples will be looked at under a microscope to see how the treatments change the scar tissue. The tissue will also have tests done to evaluate how the laser impacts genes from cells in the scar tissue.\n\nLastly, to understand how reconstructive procedures (laser and surgical treatments) change a patient's quality of life, patients will be asked a limited set of questions to learn more how these procedures improve their lives."

A border around the scar, is not required here because it is surrounded by normal skin.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous laser or reconstructive procedures for the treatment of their HTBS in the study scar or adjacent tissue.\n* Steroids, immunosuppressive medications, chemotherapy or other medications that can delay their wound healing/immune function.\n* Medical Conditions that preclude laser treatment or general anesthesia if needed\n* Cognitively unable to complete PROMs on their own\n* The study area should not be part of a contracture or other hypertrophic scar that would be better treated with surgical procedures.\n* The study scar must not be adjacent to/in continuity with areas of HTBS that are planning to be treated with surgical interventions.",
