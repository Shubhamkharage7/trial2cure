However, the researchers will test the study arms from the original PLAN study for effects on the study's dependent variables. Their between-subjects arms included Pre-pregnancy obesity with intensive weight loss intervention, pre-pregnancy obesity with standard of care intervention, and pre-pregnancy healthy weight with no intervention. So, although the researchers are not assigning babies to any arms, their original assignment will still be assessed the study analysis."
