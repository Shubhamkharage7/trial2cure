            "detailedDescription": "This study is a prospective Clinical Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in a group of 82 children with cerebral palsy. The experimental and control groups will receive effective postural-reaching training based on motor learning and control principles. In both groups, participants will engage in play and functional activities that elicit arm movement and challenge trunk postural control, and the motor tasks and activities will be progressed. The main difference is that the experimental group will be trained with TruST in order to add postural task-progression via assistive force fields; which will be tailored to the child's sitting control balance status across training sessions. However, in the control group, postural task-progression will be addressed by lowering the level of rigid trunk support segment by segment across training sessions. The trunk subregion where the support is placed will depend on the child's trunk control ability. Participants will be recruited from the United States."
