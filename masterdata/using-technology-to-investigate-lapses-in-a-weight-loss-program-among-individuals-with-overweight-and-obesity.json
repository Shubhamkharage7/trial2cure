            "briefSummary": "Approximately 70% of American adults have overweight/obesity, which increases risk of major medical issues and preventable death (Abdelaal et. al, 2017). Many individuals with overweight/obesity attempt to lose weight through behavioral strategies, e.g., adopting a reduced-calorie diet and/or increased physical activity. However, it is exceedingly difficult to consistently adhere to a reduced-calorie diet and high levels of physical activity; as such, most individuals attempting to lose weight via these methods experience repeated instances of non-adherence, i.e., dietary and physical activity lapses. These lapses are a core driver of weight loss failure, undermining individuals' ability to achieve weight control (Forman et al, 2017). As such, it is important to understand what predicts these lapses, which in turn allows for better lapse prevention. The current study proposes to measure these risk factors in an ecologically valid manner, i.e., in the moment they occur and in the context of individuals' everyday lives, using advanced technology. Specifically, the current study will use ecological momentary assessments (EMA; brief, repeated surveys delivered in one's natural environment, typically via a smartphone) and sensor technology (e.g., Fitbit and sensors on smartphone devices) to measure momentary risk factors of dietary and physical activity lapse, as well as the lapses themselves. Findings from this research project will lay the groundwork for a sophisticated just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), a tailored, personalized intervention that targets momentary risk factors (e.g., cravings) via in-the-moment support, thereby reducing lapse occurrence and improving adherence to behavioral weight control prescriptions."

Participants will be prescribed a reduced-calorie diet that will be individualized based on the individual's starting weight and weight loss goal (recommended goal of 5-10% weight loss over 12 weeks). Participants also will be prescribed a goal of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. They are also given, free of cost, a Fitbit Charge 5 health tracker, the Fitbit Aria Air digital scale, and a MyFitnessPal Premium subscription for the duration of the study.",

EMA surveys will be delivered in 2-week bursts at the beginning, middle, and end of treatment. There will be 6 EMA surveys delivered every 2-3 hours throughout the day. Each EMA survey will ask about the participant's intention to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in the next 2-3 hours and actual engagement in MVPA. Actual MVPA also will be measured through accelerometers (Fitbits). Thus, by measuring intention to engage in MVPA in the next 2-3 hours at Time 1 (e.g., EMA survey at 9:00am) and if the participant actually engaged in MVPA via accelerometer and EMA at Time 2 (2-3 hours later, e.g., at 12:00pm), we can detect a physical activity intention-behavior gap or physical activity lapse.",

Specifically, participants will be assigned a reduced-calorie diet to facilitate weight control and each will be prescribed a personalized daily calorie target. That target will then be divvied up into individual calorie targets for 3 meals and 2 snacks daily (e.g., 15% of daily calorie goal allotted for breakfast, 25% for lunch, 40% for dinner, and 10% for each of two snacks). If a participant exceeds one of these meal-specific calorie targets, it is considered a dietary lapse. Participants will log everything they eat and drink in MyFitnessPal, which automatically calculates calories and stores participant's calorie goals for meals/snacks; thus, lapses can be identified when a participant exceeds a calorie target for a meal/snack in MyFitnessPal. Participants also will report dietary lapses via EMA surveys (see above for more information about EMA surveys).",
