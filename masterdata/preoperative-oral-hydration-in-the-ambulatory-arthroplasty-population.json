            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate if the consumption of a complex carbohydrate drink preoperatively, decreases the length of stay and causes for failure to launch in patients undergoing ambulatory total joint arthroplasty.",
            "detailedDescription": "The way total joint arthroplasty is practiced continues to evolve as CMS removed total hip arthroplasty (THA) from the inpatient-only list and added total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to the ASC Covered Surgical Procedures List (CPL) in 2020. Thus, surgeons must find subtle interventions that improve patient outcomes while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions. Current literature has not assessed the influence of preoperative hydration, using a complex carbohydrate drink, on the same-day discharge rate and causes for failure to launch. Considering variabilities in perioperative fluid management leading to postoperative nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, the investigators seek to reduce the incidence of these events by optimizing patients using a preoperative oral hydration protocol, reducing the length of stay, and improving same-day discharge rates."
