            "detailedDescription": "Nasal Potential Difference (NPD) measurements will be conducted on participants. The NPD measurement, is a bioelectric assay of CFTR-dependent ion transport that has been used in a variety of protocols designed to detect CFTR function. A 4-Step protocol will be utilized. The nasal cavities will be perfused in a step-wise fashion with the following solutions: 1) Ringer's solution, 2) Ringer's solution + amiloride 100\u03bcM, 3) Low-Cl--containing solution, and 4) Low-Cl- + isoproterenol (10 \u00b5M). The potential difference will be monitored in nasal epithelium in comparison to an agar filled reference butterfly electrode placed in the volar aspect of the forearm, and connected via a calomel cell to a high impedance voltmeter.\n\nFollowing placement of the subcutaneous reference bridge, the nasal probe will be secured 1-3 cm within the inferior meatus and secured in position at the most polarizing position. Each nare will then be sequentially perfused with Ringer solution. All nasal potential difference tracings will be scored independently by a single reviewer.\n\nThe investigator and an internal committee comprised of Gregory Fleming James Associate Scientists will oversee the safety of the study. Our internal committee is a multidisciplinary group consisting of physician and subspecialists who, collectively, have experience in treatment patients with cystic fibrosis and other airway disease in the conduct of randomized clinical trials. The primary responsibility of this committee is to protect the safety and welfare of subjects consenting to the investigator's procurement of remnant tissue during endoscopic sinus procedure. Members are responsible for reviewing procedural conduct, including acquisition of consents and materials, to protect patient well-being. An interim data safety review will be conducted on a yearly basis. The committee will consist of at least 3 members with clinical trials experience in airway diseases. During annual review, issues relating to the safety and process for acquiring human tissues will be reviewed. Summary reports from each annual meeting will be prepared and will address concerns about the procurement of tissue or any other information deemed pertinent to the review."

Patients with CRS will be diagnosed according to Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership symptom-based and objective criteria as follows: i. Duration of disease is qualified by continuous symptoms (\u2265 2 major factors or at least 1 major factor \\& 2 minor symptoms; Table 2) for \u2265 12 consecutive weeks or \u2265 12 weeks of physical findings. ii.
