Participants have a diagnosis of methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Participants can expect to be actively engaged in the study for up to 26 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to determine the safety of psilocybin in adult participants with MUD.\n\nEligible participants will be adults with methamphetamine use disorder recruited from the community. After physical and psychological screening, and at least 6 hours of psychological support for the psilocybin dosing, each participant will ingest 1 oral dose of psilocybin. All dosing sessions will be attended by 2 specially trained facilitators, in a dedicated Session Room at the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy. After eight hours of observation in the dosing room, the participant will stay overnight in the hospital Clinical Research Unit, and complete an integration session with at least one of the session facilitators before discharge to home. Approximately 4 weeks after the first dose, the participant will receive a second oral dose of psilocybin, with the same length of observation.\n\nParticipants who decide not to proceed to the second dose will complete two additional integration sessions and study measures through the two-month follow-up.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in this study, please fill out a brief 1-minute survey at the link in the \"More Information\" section at the bottom of this record."
