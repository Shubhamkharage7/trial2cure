The main questions this project aims to answer are:\n\n1. What is the relative stress contributing to performance differences between women and men during intense exercise in extremely hot and humid environments in response to exertional heat stress?\n2. What is the relative contribution of responses in adipose tissue, cardiovascular tissue, gut microbiota, and musculoskeletal tissue on heat tolerance in women (vs. men) to exertional heat stress?\n3. What is the impact of adding an antioxidant juice consumption regime and will it assist in enhancing performance during an acute bout of exercise-heat stress before and after heat acclimation?\n\nSubjects enrolled and approved for participation will perform:\n\n1. a heat acclimation protocol which includes the completion of 5 days of prescribed exercise-heat exposure\n2. two separate acute exercise-heat exposures for the assessment of thermotolerance and the investigation of potential enhancements in thermoregulatory performance that may occur after the completion of a 5-day heat acclimation protocol\n3. a subset of subjects enrolled and approved for participation who opt in to antioxidant berry supplement consumption will either consume the active or placebo product throughout their participation."
