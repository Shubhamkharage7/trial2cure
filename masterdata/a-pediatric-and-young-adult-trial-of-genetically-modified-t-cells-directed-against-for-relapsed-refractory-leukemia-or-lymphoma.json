In this study, the investigators will attempt to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR used in this study can recognize CD22, a protein expressed on the surface of leukemia and lymphoma cells. The phase 1 part of this study will determine the safety and appropriate dose level of these CAR T cells, and the phase 2 part of the study will determine how effective this CAR T cell therapy is. Both patients who have never had prior CAR T cell therapy and those who have had prior CAR T cell therapy may be eligible to participate in this study."
