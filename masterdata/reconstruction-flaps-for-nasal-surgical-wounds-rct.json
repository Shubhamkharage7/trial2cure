Approximately 32 participants who are undergoing nasal tip wound reconstruction surgery will be invited to participate and randomized to receive either the nasalis sling repair or the lobed flap repair. Patients will be asked to complete a few questionnaires including a VAS scale, the Surgical Outcomes scale, the NOSE instrument, and the Nasal Appearance and Function Evaluation Questionnaire (NAFEQ).\n\nThis study was a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures."
