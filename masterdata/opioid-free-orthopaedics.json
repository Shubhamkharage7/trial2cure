            "detailedDescription": "Prolonged opioid usage after orthopaedic surgery is an important consideration for both the opioid epidemic and postoperative outcomes. The investigators have developed a multimodal pain control regimen designed to decrease or even potentially eliminate the need for opioids after an orthopedic procedure. This is a prospective double blinded randomized controlled trial utilizing a multimodal pain regimen consisting of education and our standard multimodal pain control regimen. Then, the plan is to randomize patients to receive either encapsulated opioids or placebo. The team will assess patient's pain levels, satisfaction, opioid usage, side effects, patient reported outcomes, and complications. This study will serve as a foundation for future opioid-free surgeries and investigations, while helping to identify patients and factors at risk for prolonged opioid usage postoperatively."
