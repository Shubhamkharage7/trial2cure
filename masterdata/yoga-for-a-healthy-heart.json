The program will be an 8-week program, once per week, 60 minutes in length, consisting of meditation, or relaxation, pranayama which are breathing techniques and asana, or physical postures. Yoga, is defined as the fluctuations or roaming tendencies of the mind according the Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. In addition to therapeutic yoga techniques, lifestyle management will be discussed or self-reflections written in journals. Lifestyle management skills include learning how to take blood pressure and manage a pillbox, as well as develop prosocial communication skills through lessons on mindful communication. The classes will be taught in person. The instructor facilitating the program will be a skilled healthcare professional certified in both Occupational Therapy and Yoga teaching at the 500-hour level. The Occupational Therapist will provide both skilled assessments and interventions in the group setting of the community health class. Assessments include: 1. Perceived Stress Scale 2. Canadian Occupational Performance Measurement 3. Mini and Medi-Cog 4. Blood pressure assessments pre and post class.\n\n."
