WIQ speed score assesses the degree of difficulty in walking one block at specific speeds, ranging from walking slowly to jogging, on a scale of 0 to 4. In the WIQ stair-climbing score, the participant is asked to report the degree of difficulty climbing specific numbers of flights of stairs, ranging from one to three flights of stairs, on a scale of 0 to 4.
