If BP is \u2265160 mm Hg (systolic) or \u2265100 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.\n\nPart C only: Screening supine BP \u2265140 mm Hg (systolic) or \u226590 mm Hg (diastolic) for participants \\<60 years; and \u2265150/90 mm/Hg for participants \u226560 years old, following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If systolic BP is \u2265140 or 150 mm Hg (based on age) or diastolic \u226590 mm Hg, the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.\n\n- Screening 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTcF interval \\>450 ms, complete left bundle branch block, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or third- degree atrioventricular block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).\n\nIf QTcF exceeds 450 ms, or QRS exceeds 120 ms, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.\n\n* Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat test if deemed necessary:\n\n  * AST or ALT level \u22651.5 \u00d7 ULN;\n  * Total bilirubin level \u22651.5 \u00d7 ULN; participants with an elevated total bilirubin consistent with Gilbert's Disease will have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is \u2264ULN;\n  * TSH \\> ULN;\n  * Fasting C-peptide \\<0.8 ng/mL;\n  * Serum calcitonin \\> ULN;\n  * Amylase \\> ULN;\n  * Lipase \\> ULN.\n* Fasting blood glucose\n\n  * Part A only: \\>270 mg/dL at screening or admission, confirmed by a single repeat test if deemed necessary.\n  * Parts B and C only: \\>126 mg/dL at screening or admission, confirmed by a single repeat test if deemed necessary.\n* Renal impairment as defined by an eGFR \\<75 mL/min/1.73m2. Confirmation of screening eGFR by a single repeat test is permitted, if deemed necessary.\n\n  \u2022 Based upon participant age at screening, eGFR is calculated using the recommended CKD-EPI equations in Section 10.7.2 to determine eligibility (Screat-based formula).\n* History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any illicit drug use or dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5 (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule, alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (\\[240 mL\\] beer, 1 ounce \\[30 mL\\] of 40% spirit or 3 ounces \\[90 mL\\] of wine).\n* Prior use of a GLP-1R agonist within 6 months prior to screening or known intolerance to any GLP-1R agonist.\n* Body weight exceeds the maximum capacity of the site's body weight scale, preventing accurate assessment of body weight.\n* Part C only: History of hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergic reaction associated with prior exposure to rosuvastatin, midazolam, or omeprazole.\n* Part C only: Use of tobacco/nicotine containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5 cigarettes/day or 2 chews of tobacco/day.\n* Investigator site staff directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and sponsor and sponsor delegate employees directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members.",
