            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to understand the long-term effects of the drug phentermine on weight, blood pressure, other health outcomes, and safety. Phentermine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for weight management since 1959, but it has not been approved for long-term use (i.e., treatment lasting more than 12 weeks). This trial is designed to learn about the long-term effects of phentermine for up to 2 years because obesity is a chronic disease and expert guidelines recommend long-term use of anti-obesity medications as one treatment option.",
            "detailedDescription": "The Long-term Effectiveness of the Anti-obesity medication Phentermine (LEAP) trial, a placebo-controlled, randomized trial, will be conducted at 5 clinical sites across the United States. All participants will be provided with an evidence-based online lifestyle intervention, and participants receiving 24 mg/day of phentermine vs. a placebo for up to 24 months will be compared in an intent-to-treat fashion. The co-primary outcomes of percent weight loss and change in systolic blood pressure at 24 months will be examined. Also, between group changes in drivers of energy balance, including resting metabolic rate, caloric intake, physical activity and dietary composition will be compared. To explore the effects of weight loss on cardiometabolic health, changes in heart rate, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, waist circumference, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, and novel ECG markers of cardiac strain will be compared. Overall adverse event and serious adverse event rate, including rates of incident cardiovascular disease or death, will be measured."
