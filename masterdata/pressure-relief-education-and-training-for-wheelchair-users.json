Clients may struggle with consistent performance of pressure relief and may not recall the importance, have methods to perform, or be able to perform due to weakness or other disease changes.",

Current adults of the Neurology Specialty Care practice who are complex power wheelchair users will be eligible for this project as an extension of usual care."
