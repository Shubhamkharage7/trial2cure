            "briefSummary": "Background: EP0057 consists of a sugar molecule cyclodextrin linked to a chemotherapy drug called camptothecin. The combined molecule or \"nanoparticle drug conjugate\" travels through the blood. Once inside cancer cells, the chemotherapy drug is released from the molecule. Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from repairing the DNA damage caused by chemotherapy. Researchers want to see how safe it is to give EP0057 and olaparib together and to see how well the combination treats a specific type of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo test the safety and maximum dose of EP0057 and olaparib together. To test how well they treat small cell lung cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults 18 and older with small cell lung cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with standard cancer care tests.\n\nParticipants will get the 2 study drugs in 28-day cycles. EP0057 will be given every 2 weeks, through a small plastic tube in an arm vein. Olaparib will be taken by mouth twice a day most days. Participants will keep a pill diary.\n\nFor Cycle 1, participants will have 3 visits. All other cycles will have 2 visits.\n\nAt study visits, participants may have:\n\n* Blood and hair samples taken\n* History and Physical exam\n* Questions about health and side effects\n* Pregnancy test\n* Optional tumor biopsy where a piece of tumor is removed by needle after numbing the skin.\n* CT scan\n* Injection of EP0057 (twice per cycle)\n* Olaparib prescription \\<TAB\\>\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after finish taking the drugs. They will have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have a tumor biopsy. The study team will call the patient every 3 months for follow up after completing the study treatment.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.\n\nAlthough highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes refractory to treatment within a few months.\n\nUrothelial Carcinoma (UC) of the Bladder is the fourth most common malignancy in men and the ninth most common in women.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. While prostate cancer is initially responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the median duration of sensitivity is 24-36 months. Moreover, patients develop resistance to current treatment options.\n\nThe use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy builds upon pre-clinical data in lung cancer and other cancers supporting the notion that PARP inhibitors potentiate the effect of DNA damaging therapies.\n\nDespite their highly synergistic activity in preclinical models, human studies combining PARP inhibitors and camptothecins have not translated into clinical benefit due to enhanced toxicity with the combination.\n\nOne approach to improve ability to combine camptothecins with agents that sensitize their activity like PARP inhibitors is to use alternative formulations that minimize toxicity to the normal tissues.\n\nEP0057 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20 (S)-camptothecin (a potent and highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor) conjugated to a linear, cyclodextrin-polyethylene glycol-based polymer.\n\nOlaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established safety profile and it is under investigation in a number of different cancers.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPhase I: To determine the MTD/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EP0057 in combination with olaparib in patients with refractory cancers.\n\nPhase II: To determine the antitumor activity of olaparib plus EP0057 with respect to progression free survival at 16 weeks in SCLC patients with resistant or sensitive relapse.\n\nExpansion Cohorts: To determine overall response rate of EP0057 plus olaparib in patients with mCRPC and urothelial carcinoma.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPhase I\n\nMale or female adult patients \\>=18 years of age\n\nHistologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced solid tumor that is refractory to standard therapy and/or for whom no further standard therapy is available\n\nECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2\n\nPhase II\n\nMale or female patients (Bullet) 18 years old\n\nHave a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of SCLC\n\nDisease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy regimen and/or an immune-checkpoint inhibitor for either limited or extensive stage disease.\n\nHave measurable disease per RECIST 1.1\n\nECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2\n\nPhase II Expansion Cohorts\n\nHave a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma or metastatic, progressive, castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)\n\nDisease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy regimen and/or an immune-checkpoint inhibitor (except prostate cohort)\n\nHave measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (except prostate cohort)\n\nPrior treatment with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone (prostate cancer cohort only)\n\nPatients must have castrate levels of testosterone (\\<50 ng/dl \\[1.74 nmol/l\\]) (Prostate cohort only)\n\nDesign:\n\nPatients meeting eligibility criteria will receive EP0057 (IV Q 2weeks) plus olaparib (PO BID days 3-13 and days 17-26 administered in 28-day cycles, until disease progression or development of intolerable side effects. The MTD of the combination will be used in Phase II.\n\nPatients in Phase II will receive, the RP2D at DL4R EP0057 12 mg/m\\^2 and olaparib 250 mg BID.\n\nBlood, tumor and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points for PK, PD analyses. Hair sample collection is optional. Tumor biopsies are optional for SCLC and UC patients and mandatory for mCRPC patients (only baseline biopsy is mandatory).\n\nToxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0.\n\nTumor assessments will be made using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline and after every 2 cycles (3 cycles for mCRPC) according to RECIST version 1.1.\n\nAfter discontinuation of study treatment, follow-up for survival will be carried out every 3 months.\n\nThe maximum number of patients on the phase I portion of the trial is 30, the SCLC cohort in phase II may accrue up to 27 evaluable patients, urothelial carcinoma expansion cohort may accrue up to 34 patients and mCRPC may accrue up to 25 patients. Thus, the maximum number of evaluable patients who may enroll on this trial is 116. In order to allow for a small number of in-evaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 123.\n\nIt is anticipated that approximately 1 to 2 patients per month may enroll onto this trial; the trial is expected to complete accrual in 6-8 years."
