Participants will develop skills to better deal with emotions by increasing awareness of what is happening in different settings and choose how to respond. Skill-building exercises may include mindfulness practices, flexible thinking, behavioral activation, problem-solving, and exposure activities.",

Adolescents must be, or are willing to be, consented to receive services through School Health Initiative (SHI) (i.e., SHI consent).

Individuals who do not wish to participate in this study and/or who are not able to read and understand the consent/assent.\n   2. Individuals with self- or caregiver-reported history of seizures, neurological problems, autism spectrum disorder, substance use disorder, or serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia), and any indicator of a significant cognitive delay that would make U-PEACE inappropriate (e.g., full-time special education placement)\n   3. Individuals with current anxiety or depressive symptoms or active suicidality at levels where more intensive services (e.g., day treatment, inpatient) would be warranted (e.g., hospitalization for suicidal behavior in the last 12 months).\n2. Ineligible adolescents will be provided referrals to medical providers at the SHI, community agencies contracted with the Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS) Office of Mental Health Services or emergency room settings, as appropriate.\n3.
