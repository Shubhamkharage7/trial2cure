The objective of this study is to determine if immediate postoperative strength training of the contralateral (non-surgical) lower extremity reduces postoperative loss of strength in an immobilized lower extremity.\n\nAfter the completion of surgery, patients will be randomized to either the experimental treatment (Group 1) or control group (Group II)for postoperative rehabilitation.",
            "detailedDescription": "Group I will receive knee flexion and extension strength training exercises for the contralateral (non-operative) lower extremity in addition to standard of care postoperative rehabilitation. The experimental strength training will be performed with moderate resistance and will require moderate effort. Exercises will include unilateral leg presses, lunges, step ups, and step downs. These exercises are performed as standard of care but are not typically introduced into the physical therapy regimen until 10-12 weeks postoperatively. In the experimental group, these exercises will be introduced starting with the first postoperative physical therapy session, but only for the contralateral (non-operative) leg."
