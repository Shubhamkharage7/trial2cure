Comparing MRE with the typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may help researchers assess the quality, reliability, and diagnostic utility of this scan when evaluating brain tumors.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examine tolerance interval of MRE measurement in kilopascals (kPa) and associated distribution of percent stiff (hard) and soft tumors above the higher limit and below the lower limit.\n\nII. Through machine learning with MRE and clinical/demographic factors, to identify diagnostic thresholds in separating stiff tumor from soft tumor.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo MRE scan over 25 minutes before surgery at the time of standard of care pre-operative MRI scan. On the day of surgery, the surgeon grades and records tumor consistency/stiffness during the operation and afterwards."
