The purpose of this pivotal randomized double-blind study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of DMX-200 120 mg twice daily (BID) compared with placebo over a treatment period of 104 weeks in adult patients with FSGS who are being treated with an ARB. Given the rarity of the disease and the similarities between adults and pediatric patients with FSGS, Dimerix will also investigate the efficacy and safety of DMX 200 in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The double-blind period will be followed by an open-label extension (OLE) which aims to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of DMX 200 for up to 2 additional years.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a pivotal Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of DMX-200 in patients with FSGS. The duration of the double-blind period per patient is estimated to be maximum of 122 weeks, a Screening and Qualification period of between 6 and 14 weeks (including a 4 week period to complete the assessments required for Screening, Titration (if required, up to 4 weeks) and, 6-weeks of Stabilization, a 104-week Treatment period, and up to a 4-week off-treatment Follow-up period. The treatment duration of the OLE period per patient is estimated to be a minimum of 104 weeks (2 years) with a 4-week off-treatment Follow-up period. The total study duration (double-blind period and OLE combined) is currently estimated to be a minimum of 230 weeks."
