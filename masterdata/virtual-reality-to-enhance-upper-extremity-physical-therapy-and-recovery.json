It hypothesizes that the treatment will display improved compliance, range of motion, and general function for individuals with upper extremity musculoskeletal deficits.\n\nThe primary objectives are to: 1. Describe participant compliance with an immersive game-based virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation device for delivering at-home occupational therapy exercises for the wrist and hand in individuals with motor impairments. 2. Describe and compare functional outcomes among participants before and after completing at-home rehabilitation using the VR system.\n\nThese objective outcomes will be measured through various standardized tests completed by qualified study team members."
