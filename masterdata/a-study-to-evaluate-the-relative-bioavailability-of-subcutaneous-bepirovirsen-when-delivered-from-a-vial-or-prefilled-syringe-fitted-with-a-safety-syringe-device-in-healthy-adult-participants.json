The aim of this study is to provide relative bioavailability data to support the transition from the vial presentation of bepirovirsen, to a ready-to-use liquid in a PFS SSD when both are given by a health care professional. The study will also assess self-administration using the PFS SDD, and the safety and tolerability of bepirovirsen."
