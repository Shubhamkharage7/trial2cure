            "briefSummary": "This phase II trial compares the impact of subcutaneous (SC) nivolumab given in an in-home setting to an in-clinic setting on cancer care and quality of life. Currently, most drug-related cancer care is conducted in clinic type centers or hospitals which may isolate patients from family, friends and familiar surroundings for many hours per day. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. Traveling to and from medical facilities costs time, money, and effort and can be a disadvantage to patients living in rural areas, those with low incomes or poor access to transport. Studies have shown that cancer patients often feel more comfortable and secure being cared for in their own home environments. SC nivolumab in-home treatment may be safe, tolerable and/or effective when compared to in-clinic treatment and may reduce the burden of cancer and improve the quality of life in cancer patients.",
            "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the change in patient-reported rating of Cancer Connected Access and Remote Expertise (CARE) after 8 weeks in clinic compared to the same rating after 8 weeks at home.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate patient preference for location of cancer treatment administration, in the clinic or in the home.\n\nII. Longitudinally assess patient-reported function and global health/quality of life.\n\nIII. Longitudinally assess patient-reported symptoms. IV. Assess the safety of cancer directed therapy when administered at home by a home health provider with remote patient monitoring and command center support.\n\nV. Describe emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of the study.\n\nVI. Describe overall survival (data collected out to 1 year).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Assess the cost outcomes related to patient treatment in the clinic or in the home.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nivolumab SC on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in clinic for 2 cycles, then at home by a home health nursing provider (HHNP) for 4 cycles, followed by either in-clinic or at-home administration for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive in-home visits by a home health nurse, undergo remote patient monitoring including vital sign measurements and condition-specific symptom assessments throughout study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 30 and 100, then every 3 months for up to 1 year."
