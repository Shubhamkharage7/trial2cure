            "briefSummary": "This study plans to learn more about postoperative pain management after cesarean deliveries (C-sections). As a part of standard of care, the Children's Hospital Colorado's Colorado Fetal Care Center (CFCC) follows the standard Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean (ERAC) guidelines to manage pain following C-section delivery. In addition, the CFCC uses an FDA approved medical device called the ON-Q \u00ae Pump, which continuously delivers local anesthetic medication to control pain in the area of your procedure. The local anesthetic used is bupivacaine, which is FDA approved for use to control local pain after C-sections. The CFCC has found a significant reduction in opioid use after adopting both of these procedures. The study aims to determine if the ERAC protocol or ON-Q \u00ae Pump continuous infusion is responsible for lower opioid use by comparing bupivacaine (treatment) versus saline (placebo) groups."
