A novel clinical model for infants with rare genetic disorders has been created as a joint initiative between the Division of Newborn Medicine's NICU Growth and Developmental Support Programs (NICU GraDS) program and the Division of Genetics at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). This study plans to enroll patients with genetic syndromes seen in this clinic into a prospective, longitudinal study in order to characterize their developmental profiles and needs.",

A novel clinical model for infants with rare genetic disorders has been created as a joint initiative between the Division of Newborn Medicine's NICU Growth and Developmental Support Programs (NICU GraDS) program and the Division of Genetics at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). This study plans to enroll patients with genetic syndromes seen in this clinic into a prospective, longitudinal study in order to characterize their developmental profiles and needs. Related factors such as quality of life and parental stress will also be assessed which will complement the evaluation of the role of a \"developmental home\" for these high risk infants. It is also hypothesized that gaps in care - mismatches between services received and services indicated based upon the developmental evaluation - will be identified. The results of this study will be used to inform future research efforts utilizing targeted approaches to improve developmental outcomes.\n\nFor infants with rare genetic disorders, the aims are as follows:\n\nAim 1: Characterize physical and psychosocial development using standardized longitudinal assessments.\n\nAim 2: Identify developmental service needs, prescription, and utilization.\n\nAim 3: Assess parental stress and health-related quality of life."
