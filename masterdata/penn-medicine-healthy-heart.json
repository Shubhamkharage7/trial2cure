            "detailedDescription": "To leverage access to patients across the primary care network, EPIC tools for identifying eligible patients, and the Way to Health platform to launch and enroll Penn Medicine primary care patients into the Penn Medicine Healthy Heart, a six-month program for reduction of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia grounded in behavioral economics insights to increase uptake of and adherence to evidence-based interventions to reduce ASCVD risk. Penn Medicine Healthy Heart emphasizes proactive outreach and prevention outside of a traditional visit model using data assets to identify and risk stratify patients. The program aims to relieve overburdened PCPs through automated hovering technology coupled with a centralized, leveraged team of non-clinical navigators and nurse practitioners. The clinical trial will assess Penn Medicine Healthy Heart and will be powered to detect differences in improving blood pressure and cholesterol over 6 months for Penn Medicine patients in West/Southwest/Downtown Philadelphia and Lancaster, PA."
