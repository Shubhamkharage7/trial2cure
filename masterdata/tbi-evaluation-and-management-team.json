The project aims to improve and support mTBI diagnosis and management, and improve critical decision making by clinicians during their interaction with the injured child, their family, and their school.",
            "detailedDescription": "Emergency, urgent care, and primary care providers participating in the study will be block randomized in a 1:1 ratio by practice type to receive the intervention or continue with their standard practice. All enrolled clinicians (both trained and control providers) patients they care for will be screened for inclusion in the trial.\n\nAdditionally, a pre/post intervention will be layered upon the randomized educational intervention to evaluate the effects of the information technology decision support tool (i.e. eMR) in isolation of the clinician education intervention. The 32-month mTBI patient enrollment period will be divided into two 16 months segments. The first 16 months will be without the eMR intervention being visible, and the remaining 16 months post eMR screening and decision support deployment in the ED and UC. This study design allows us to evaluate the independent and interactive effects of the decision support tool and educational intervention.\n\nEnrolled children will be followed for up to three months post injury to ascertain the effect of the interventions on the primary aim (reduction of school problems/performance) and secondary aims."
