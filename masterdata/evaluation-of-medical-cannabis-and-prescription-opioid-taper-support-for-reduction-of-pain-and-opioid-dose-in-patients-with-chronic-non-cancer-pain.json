            "detailedDescription": "This trial is a randomized, six-month study of medical marijuana (MM) on opioid use that will: (1) evaluate whether adults with chronic, non-cancer pain on COT assigned to MM+POTS, compared with those assigned to WL+POTS, have greater reduction in opioid dose and/or pain intensity and interference, (2) assess whether participants assigned to MM+POTS, compared with those assigned to WL+POTS, have improved quality of life, depression, and anxiety; and reduced self-reported opioid dose, (3) evaluate whether those assigned to MM+POTS develop symptoms of CUD and have a reduced number of OUD symptoms over the 24-week intervention, as well as at the 12-month time point.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to either an active MM arm (n = 125), or to a waitlist control arm (WLC) (n = 125). Participants will be assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks for 6 months, and at a 12-month follow-up for opioid use, development of CUD, development or resolution of OUD, and neurocognitive performance. Urine collected will be assessed with quantitative assays."
