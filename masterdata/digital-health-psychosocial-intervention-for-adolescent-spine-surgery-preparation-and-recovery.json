            "briefSummary": "This is a randomized controlled trial to test effectiveness of the SurgeryPal intervention vs. education control to improve acute and chronic pain and health outcomes in youth undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery. Youth will be randomized on an individual level using a factorial design to SurgeryPal or Education during 2 phases of intervention: 1) pre-operative phase (4 week duration delivered over the 4 weeks leading up to surgery), and 2) post-operative phase (4 week duration following surgery). Thus there will be 4 treatment arms. Participants will undergo 4 assessments, independent of their treatment assignment: T1: Baseline (pre-randomization); T2: acute post-surgery outcomes (daily assessment of acute outcomes beginning day 1 through day 14 after hospital discharge from surgery); T3: Post-surgery follow-up (assessment of outcomes at 3-months post-surgery); T4: Final post-surgery follow-up (assessment of outcomes at 6-months post-surgery).",
            "detailedDescription": "Major musculoskeletal surgeries are associated with particularly high prevalence of both acute and chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), with 80% of youth reporting intense acute pain after hospital discharge, and up to half reporting CPSP up to one year after spine surgery. Interventions to improve recovery and reduce pain after surgery have potential to interrupt a negative trajectory of suffering and disability associated with chronic pain. Our specific aims are: Primary: (1) Determine effectiveness of a pre-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve acute pain outcomes in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (2) Determine effectiveness of a post-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to improve chronic pain outcomes at 3 months in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, (3) Determine the combined effects of pre- and post-operative psychosocial intervention on chronic pain outcomes. Secondary: (1) Determine effectiveness of pre-operative psychosocial intervention to reduce opioid use during the 14 days following hospital discharge, (2) Determine effectiveness of psychosocial intervention to improve health-related quality of life following surgery."

SurgeryPal is delivered in two 4-week phases: the pre-operative phase, and the post-operative phase. Each phase consists of 3 separate treatment modules for youth and parents, which teach cognitive and behavioral coping skills to target known psychosocial and behavioral risk factors (i.e. anxiety/distress and sleep disturbance) for poorer postsurgical outcomes, and provide training in pain self-management skills. Pre-operative modules include: 1) Preparing for surgery, 2) Coping with stress before surgery, and 3) Getting ready for the hospital. Postoperative modules include: 1) Coping at home after surgery, 2) Return to activities and school, and 3) Long-term recovery. Modules are self-guided and interactive, and focus on phases of preparation and recovery from surgery. The goal of the program is to reduce pain and enhance quality of life following surgery in youth.",

The database will be produced and will be completely de-identified in accordance with the definitions provided in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The DCC will also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database. In accordance with policies of the NIH, the DCC will send the releasable database to the entity determined by the NIH or specific institute to be the repository for data created under the HEAL initiative. The DCC is able to produce a relational database export, or use SAS or SPSS data sets. The DCC will accompany the database with full documentation so that individual investigators will be able to effectively use the data.",

The policies for release of this database are in accordance with the HEAL Data Sharing policy as determined by the NIH. Our preliminary plan is to release the underlying primary database at the time of publication of the primary manuscript. The primary publication from the dataset will be made publicly available immediately without any embargo period through the Creative Commons Generic License in accordance with the HEAL Public Access guidance. Additional secondary publications will be deposited electronically within 4 weeks of acceptance into PubMed Central.",
