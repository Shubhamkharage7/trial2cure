All outcome measures will be completed at Baseline (T2), Post-treatment (1-2 weeks following treatment completion, T3), 10 week post treatment completion follow up (T4), and 6 month post treatment completion follow up (T5)."

The children progress through skills including relaxation training, arousal ratings, problem size, mindfulness, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility. The caregivers learn crisis management, reward systems, and coaching strategies for topics taught to the children. Homework is utilized to reinforce use of skills outside the group. The canines are present throughout as both a calming presence and teaching assistant. Children will be able to interact with the dog when practicing relaxation at the beginning of each session and throughout the session. Additionally, the dog will help to emphasize certain curriculum concepts.",
