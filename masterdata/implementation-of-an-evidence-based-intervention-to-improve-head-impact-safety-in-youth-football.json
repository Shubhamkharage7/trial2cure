            "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing an evidence-based intervention program, COmmunities Aligned to reduce Concussion and Head impact exposure (COACH) on a larger scale. Coaches of 12U (12 years old and under), and 13U (13 years old and under) teams within six youth football organizations will pilot test the intervention. Aim 1 will conduct focus groups with coaches, parents, and organizational leaders to assess organizational needs, capacity, and readiness to adopt the intervention program. Aim 2 will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention program at reducing HIE and injuries and evaluate implementation success. Aim 2 results (intervention outcomes) are reported herein.",
            "detailedDescription": "Coaches of teams at the 12U and 13U levels within the six youth football organizations will be invited to pilot test the intervention program. Intervention outcomes will be compared to historic controls (K25HD101686 - NCT04908930). Video taken at all practices will be used to monitor team activities of 12U and 13U teams across all organizations participating in the intervention; incidence of injuries will be monitored across all teams. Athletes (n=30) enrolled across two of six participating teams will be recruited to participate in parallel biomechanical and video data collection to evaluate the frequency and severity of head impacts experienced throughout the season. Biomechanical data will be collected using instrumented mouth guards and verified with video. Preliminary effectiveness will be measured by the percentage of coaches who choose to adopt and maintain the intervention program. Head impact exposure and injury rates will be compared across the intervention and control teams."
