            "briefSummary": "Perilunate injuries can be debilitating injuries that involve the carpus. These can limit patients' functionality both acutely and long-term. Not only do their potential for nerve injury increase risk of lasting weakness and chronic pain, but their complex surrounding involving the carpus also leads to potential for misalignment when healing. The approach for treating perilunate injuries often relies on internal fixation, prompting the need for surgery. However, there is no clear recommendation for whether to pursue open or arthroscopic surgery as both offer benefits and pose risks.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the similarities and differences in outcomes for management of perilunate injuries.",
            "detailedDescription": "Perilunate injuries are those that affect the wrist, which can be debilitating to patients. Often, these injuries require surgical treatment, which can either be performed open or arthroscopic. There is currently no consensus for which approach offers better outcomes. Therefore, this study will allocate patients who require surgical treatment of perilunate injuries to either open or arthroscopic surgical intervention to compare their outcomes. The results will offer insight into the compromises made with each surgical approach and create a foundation orthopedic surgeons can leverage to decide how to manage a patient to ensure best possible outcomes.\n\nThis study will involve 12 patients who were identified as having perilunate injuries requiring orthopedic surgical treatment. Their participation will involve consenting to be randomly allocated to the surgical approach, and they will be asked to complete commonly used orthopedic surveys (eg DASH score) that are used to evaluate the functional healing of their injury. They will be followed for up to 1 year after their surgery. A chart review will be conducted to follow their progress and surgical outcomes.\n\nPatients will be recruited from Grady Memorial Hospital. No specimens will be collected or banked for this study."
