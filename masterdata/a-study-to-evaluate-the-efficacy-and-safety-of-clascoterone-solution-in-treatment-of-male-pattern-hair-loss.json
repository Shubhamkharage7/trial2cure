            "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to see if Clascoterone can help people with male pattern hair loss to recovery and see if the treatment is effective and safe and how well the drug is tolerated by subjects.\n\nWithin this study, the Clascoterone solution will be compared to a placebo.\n\nThe study has 2 parts:\n\nPart 1 will see if Clascoterone solution is effective and safe compared to a placebo when applied twice daily for up to 6 months.\n\nPart 2 will see the long-term safety and efficacy of the Clascoterone solution compared to placebo for additional 6 months in subjects defined as ''responders'' in Part 1. A responder is defined as someone who have responded to the study drug, based on research data.\n\nPart 1 of the study is double-blind, meaning that neither the subject nor the study doctor knows which treatment subject is receiving. Part 2 of the study is single-blind and only the study doctor doing the study knows which treatment subject is receiving.\n\nPart 1 of the study will start with baseline visit during which subjects will be randomly assigned (by chance) in ratio 2:1 to apply either Clascoterone or placebo solution to their balding areas of the scalp. Subjects will have 5 clinic visits and 2 follow-up phone calls during 6 months of Part 1 duration. Subjects identified as Part 1 responders at Month 6 visit will be again randomly assigned in ratio 2:1 to receive either study drug or placebo.\n\nPart 2 of the study will consist of 2 additional clinic visits and treatment will last for further 6 months.\n\nEach subject will have also an end of study visit one month after the study drug treatment has been completed or discontinued (it will be one month after end of Part 1 for not responder subjects).\n\nFor those subjects who complete the whole study (Part 1 and Part 2), the total duration of the study will be about 14 months, with 12 months of treatment with a total of eight clinic visits and two phone calls.\n\nSubjects taking part in this study will have the medical tests or procedures described below.\n\n* They will be asked about their previous medical history and current medications.\n* A brief physical examination will be performed.\n* Vital signs, weight and height will be measured.\n* Electrocardiograms will be performed.\n* Subject's scalp will be checked for any signs of irritation.\n* Two different types of photos will be taken during this study: \"global photos\", i.e. general photos of the subject's scalp and \"macro photos\", i.e. close up photos of a region of the subject's scalp. Global photos will be taken to help the subject and the study doctor to assess whether there has been a change in subject's hair growth. Macro photos will be used to count the number of hairs in a region of the subject's scalp and measure other properties of the hair (hair width and hair darkness).\n* Blood draws and urine sample collection for safety laboratory tests.\n* Subject will be asked to complete, on site, the following two questionnaires:\n\n  * Cosmetic Evaluation - a couple of cosmetic questions on acceptability and how easy the study drug is to use.\n  * Male Androgenetic Alopecia Questionnaire - some questions about subject's hair assessment.\n\nEligible subjects will be given a supply of the study drug and shown how to use and store it. The first study drug dose will be applied at the clinic under the supervision of the study staff. Subjects will be instructed to apply about 1.5 ml of study drug with a dropper to the balding areas of the scalp on the vertex and the temples twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.\n\nSubjects will be asked to bring back all used containers of study drug and all unused study drug to each study visit. Subjects will also be given a diary, shown what things have to be recorded on it and asked to bring back the completed diary to the study center at each visit."
