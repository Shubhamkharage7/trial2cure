This study will allow us to estimate the standard deviation of the primary endpoint in our population with which a formal power calculation for a future randomized, controlled trial can be performed.",

In-person assessments will occur 5 times: Day 1, following 2-3 weeks on waitlist, following 8 weeks on waitlist, following 2-3 weeks of chiropractic care, and following 8 weeks of chiropractic care. Patient-reported outcomes will additionally be sent prior to the first in-person assessment (Day 0).\n\nAssessments will include the following:\n\n1. Seated resting recording\n2. Sit-to-stand test\n3. Patient-reported outcome surveys\n\nEach assessment will consist of the following recordings:\n\n1. Electroencephalography \\[EEG\\]\n2. Impedance cardiography \\[ICG\\]\n3. Electrocardiogram \\[ECG\\]"
