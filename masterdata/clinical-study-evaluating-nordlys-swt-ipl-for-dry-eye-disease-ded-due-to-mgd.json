IPL pulses will be administered on the skin of the malar region and below the lower eyelids. Following IPL therapy, subjects will undergo MGX of both eyelids in both eyes. Subjects in the control group will receive the same treatment (IPL followed by MGX), except that the IPL administration will be performed with the device off (sham treatment). Follow-up visits will occur at 1 month and 3 months after the final treatment session. At the follow-up, the changes in the outcome measures will be evaluated and compared between the two groups."
