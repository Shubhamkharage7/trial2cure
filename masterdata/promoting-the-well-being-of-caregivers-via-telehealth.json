            "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn which types of telehealth-based treatments best fit the needs of caregivers of people with rare neurogenetic conditions. The main questions it plans to answer are:\n\n* Which telehealth support programs best meet the needs of rare disorder caregivers?\n* How can individuals be matched to support programs that are right for them? What aspects of an individual (e.g., demographics, mental health symptoms, family characteristics, lifestyle) predict whether treatment will be a good fit?\n* Does peer-to-peer coaching help improve patients' experiences during telehealth treatment?\n\nParticipants will be asked to complete a 12-week treatment program, which may include self-guided resources, individual therapies, group therapies, and/or peer-to-peer coaching.\n\nBefore, during, and after treatment, participants will complete questionnaires to help researchers understand their experiences, symptoms, and impressions of their support program. Questionnaires will include both standard forms (administered up to 5 times throughout the study) and brief \"snapshot surveys\" that participants complete on their smartphones up to 3 times per day.\n\nSome participants will be assigned to a waitlist control, which means that they will provide data while they are not yet completing a support program. These participants will be assigned to a support program in the next treatment phase.",
            "detailedDescription": "Project WellCAST (Supporting Wellbeing of Caregivers via Telehealth) is a multi-phase research study that aims to develop a scalable, personalized health approach for supporting caregivers of people with rare disorders. Two previous studies by this research team have piloted individual interventions in subsets of rare disorder caregiving communities to establish initial feasibility and acceptability. Now in its third phase, Project WellCAST 3.0 aims to generate a scalable, innovative model for personalizing digital treatments to caregiver needs. This project has two specific aims:\n\nAIM 1: Develop and optimize a personalized health algorithm to match neurogenetic syndrome (NGC) caregivers to digital health treatments using a combination of standard clinical tools and smartphone-based EMA data.\n\nExtant clinical and EMA data on NGC caregiver response to COVID-19 was used to develop an initial routing algorithm to match families to treatment type and intensity. This aim will compare the effectiveness of algorithm-assigned treatment to \"treatment as usual,\" optimizing the algorithm across four waves of intervention. Interventions will be brief, evidence-based, digital health treatments administered by highly supervised clinical trainees, a cost-efficient model for directly targeting the secondary health effects of COVID-19.\n\nAIM 2: Test the efficacy of peer-to-peer coaching, deployed by trained NGC caregivers using an evidence-based motivational interviewing protocol, in enhancing treatment uptake and clinical outcomes.\n\nPeer coaches who are also NGC caregivers will be trained to deploy evidence-based Participation Enhancement Interventions designed to support treatment engagement and reduce potential barriers. This aim will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in reducing secondary health effects of COVID-19 by comparing outcomes across participants who were randomized to complete treatment with and without peer coaches. Peer coaches will also provide valuable stakeholder input for designing and optimizing the digital treatment network.\n\nDETAILED HUMAN SUBJECTS PROCEDURE:\n\nENROLLMENT AND CONSENT 1. At the entry of the study, caregivers will be assessed by the study team to determine eligibility. The caregivers will then consent to baseline collection. A subset of caregivers will be enrolled at this phase as waitlist controls. Waitlist controls will complete the same data collection described below, but without any support program.\n\nBASELINE. The baseline period of the study lasts two weeks. During this time, caregivers will complete initial study forms and \"snapshot surveys,\" which are brief questionnaires sent three times per day via their smartphones.\n\nROUTING. After baseline data collection is complete, caregivers will be routed to a support program. Random number generators will be used to route caregivers to their study arm, described below.\n\nCaregivers may opt out of broadly completing either child-focused or self-focused treatments but may not select their specific treatment modality. As an exception, any Black caregiver in the study is eligible to add the CICBT group to their assigned support program.\n\nCONSENT 2 and INTERVENTION. Participants will provide informed consent specific to their assigned intervention then begin their 12-week support program. Programs are described below. During intervention, caregivers will be asked to complete study forms to assess how their characteristics and experiences have changed interventions; forms will be collected at start of treatment, midpoint, and endpoint. Caregivers will also complete \"snapshot surveys\" (3x/day) during this time.\n\nFOLLOW UP. Two weeks after completing treatment, caregivers will complete follow-up forms and a 2-week period of \"snapshot surveys.\"\n\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES:\n\nThis study will occur across four phases. Phases I and II will enroll up to 500 participants (to yield 400 participants total) who will be randomly assigned to Algorithm (Algorithm 1 versus No Algorithm) and Peer Coaching (Peer Coaching versus No Peer Coaching).\n\nAfter Phase II, investigators will convene a \"think tank\" that will evaluate primary and secondary endpoints across arms, with the goal of determining how to optimize the algorithm. Data analyses will be performed by staff who are not involved in clinical operations. Peer coaches (who are rare disorder caregivers), clinicians, biostatisticians, and scientists will collaboratively participate in this think tank, with the goal to optimize the algorithm prior to Phase III.\n\nPhase III will enroll up to 250 participants (to yield 200) who will receive the optimized Algorithm 2 and be randomly assigned to Peer Coaching conditions. After Phase III, a second think tank will be convened to optimize Algorithm 3.\n\nPhase IV will enroll up to 250 participants (to yield 200) who will receive the optimized Algorithm 3 and will be randomly assigned to Peer Coaching conditions.\n\nFinal analyses will compare Algorithm 3 to Algorithm 2, Algorithm 1, and Waitlist Controls.\n\nRIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY.\n\nAlgorithms will be uploaded to a secure, locked site prior to each round of study assignment. Analyses will be preregistered, and all code will be available for replication efforts. Masking procedures are described elsewhere in this document."
