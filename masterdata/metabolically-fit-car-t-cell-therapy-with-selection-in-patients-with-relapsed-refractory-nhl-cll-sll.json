            "detailedDescription": "Although CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is a dynamic scientific and clinical breakthrough for CD19+ NHL, issues still remain in terms of relapse, toxicity, and availability. This trial will incorporate a CD34 tag (CD34t) into the CAR T-cell construct, thus allowing a more purified CAR T-cell product via CD34 selection. This purification step will hopefully lead to an improvement in safety/toxicity. Furthermore, the issue of CD19 CAR T-cell relapse has been linked to a lack of CAR T-cell fitness. With the knowledge that Th1 T-cell subsets have improved effector function and Th17 T-cell subsets have improved persistence, the investigators plan to expose the collected T-cells to priming conditions that lead to a metabolically enhanced CAR-T cell product akin to a Th1/17 hybrid cell. The investigators hypothesize that these metabolically programmed CD19 CAR-T cells will yield a high- quality product with enhanced persistence and anti-tumor efficacy when purified based on CD34t expression."

Participants with prior history of malignancy other than lymphoma unless subject is free of disease for more than 1 year from signing consent. Exceptions include the following:\n\n      * Basal cell carcinoma of the skin\n      * Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n      * Carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast\n      * Previously treated localized prostate cancer with normal PSA levels\n   7. Participants with primary immunodeficiency or history of autoimmune disease (e.g. Crohn's, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus) requiring systemic immunosuppression/systemic disease modifying agents within the last 1 year.\n   8. Participants with receipt of live vaccine within 28 days prior to registration.\n   9. Participants with history of autologous stem cell transplant within the last 60 days or allogeneic stem cell transplant within the last 90 days or CAR T-cell therapy within the last 180 days.\n   10. Participants with a history of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in the study\n   11. Participants with any other illness that in the opinion of the investigator, would exclude the patient from participating in this study.\n   12. Participants must not have evidence of active CNS lymphoma involvement. This includes parenchymal, spinal cord, meningeal, or cerebrospinal fluid involvement. Patients with history of CNS involvement must have documented remission by contrast-enhanced MRI imaging and CSF evaluation for at least 60 days prior to registration.\n   13. Patients must not have any unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, or symptoms consistent with NYHA CHF classification III or IV\n   14. Participants with receipt of live vaccine within 28 days prior to registration.\n   15. Participants with history of autologous stem cell transplant within the last 60 days or allogeneic stem cell transplant within the last 90 days or CAR T-cell therapy within the last 180days.\n   16. Participants with a history of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in the study\n   17.
