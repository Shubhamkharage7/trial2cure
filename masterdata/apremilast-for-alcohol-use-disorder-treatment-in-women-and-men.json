Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be assigned to apremilast (60mg/day). Titration to steady state medication levels will occur over 6 days (Day 1-6). Subjects will then complete two laboratory sessions and a cue-reactivity session (Days 7-21). During each laboratory session, personalized imagery (within- subject factor, either stress or neutral/relaxing, order counterbalanced) will precede a 2-hour alcohol self-administration period.\n\nNo taper medication is needed. Following the medication discontinuation (Day 22), subjects will be contacted to assess any side effect from discontinuing medication (Day 36).\n\nAdverse events are evaluated at each study appointment and will be tabulated."
