            "briefSummary": "Excessive anxiety is a common problem that severely impairs short and long term academic functioning. The transition to middle school (MS) results in increases in anxiety and decreases in academic functioning. Students with anxiety in particular, due to their vulnerability to school-based stressors, are at risk for social, emotional and academic failure during the transition to MS. Unfortunately, the majority of these students do not get identified. Reducing student anxiety has been associated with improvement in academic functioning. Because the transition to MS is inevitable, targeting students with excessive anxiety will help their adjustment to their new school setting, reducing the need for special education and mental health counseling. No interventions exist to help these students with this transition.\n\nThis study aims to: (1) develop and assess the feasibility of a brief, multi-component intervention, referred to as TEAMSS, Transitioning Emotionally and Academically to Middle School Successfully, to reduce anxiety and improve academic functioning through the transition to MS using an iterative development process (i.e., expert review, two open trials, and small randomized controlled trial (RCT)); (2) conduct a pilot RCT comparing the preliminary impact of TEAMSS, relative to enhanced usual care (EUC), in improving students' social, behavioral, and academic functioning through the transition to MS; and (3) examine theory-based mediators, predictors, and moderators of TEAMSS and assess intervention costs.",
            "detailedDescription": "The pilot RCT will be conducted with approximately 8 school-based clinicians from 6-8 middles schools (MS). Approximately 42 5th grade students from 12 elementary schools with elevated anxiety will be recruited. The RCT will be conducted in 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1 - Recruitment, Screening, Baseline Evaluation and Randomization: In Phase 1, 5th grade students will be referred to study staff for screening and evaluation from 5th grade teachers, clinicians and parents and self-referrals. Interested parents and students will contact study staff and complete a brief phone screen. Families who pass the screen will complete informed consent and the full baseline evaluation (consisting of a diagnostic interview and questionnaires) with an Independent Evaluator.\n\nPhase 2 - Intervention and Monitoring: Eligible students will be randomized (1:1) to TEAMSS (n = 21) or Enhanced Usual Care (EUC; n= 21). Students in both groups will receive the 5th grade components but only students randomized to TEAMSS will receive the TEAMSS group sessions (in 6th grade), delivered over 10 weeks. During the 10 weeks of TEAMSS, parents of students will attend two group meetings and clinicians will consult with at least one MS teacher.\n\nPhase 3 - Post- and Follow-up Evaluations: At the end of the 10-week intervention/EUC phase, students in both groups will complete the post-intervention (3 months into transition year i.e., December). Five months after the intervention ends (8 months into the transition year i.e., May), students in both groups will complete a follow up evaluation to assess the durability of the intervention. A seventh group with students, and a third group for parents, occurring approximately four weeks after session 6 will be conducted to debrief (discuss their experience in the program), ask them about any lingering questions or concerns related to anxiety, and update them on what was learned."
