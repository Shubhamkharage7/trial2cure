            "briefSummary": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) remains a major public health problem particularly for mothers in the perinatal period, for whom stress, relapse rates, and risk for overdose are elevated. The perinatal period is characterized by significant neural reorganization that determines outcomes for mothers and infants. OUD is also associated with neural reorganization, specifically neural circuitry implicated in stress regulation and reward processes. Interventions should therefore take advantage of this changing perinatal biology to enhance treatment response by targeting the aberrant neural circuitry compromised by maternal OUD. The investigators have developed and refined an evidence-based intervention for mothers with OUD designed to target these neural mechanisms and enhance the reward of caregiving; however, this has yet to be formally tested. Therefore, the investigators will examine maternal neuroplasticity using high-dense array electroencephalography (EEG) in mothers with OUD in response to our intervention. There will be 1 laboratory visit at pre-treatment, followed by 12 sessions of the evidence-based parenting intervention, and 1 laboratory visit at post-treatment. This study will attempt to validate the importance of taking advantage of the neuroplasticity in the perinatal period to optimize outcomes for mothers with OUD.",
            "detailedDescription": "This is a study conducted at the Child Study Center (CSC) in the Yale School of Medicine. It involves mothers in treatment for OUD who are caring for infants who are 4-12 months old.\n\n15 mothers will complete 1 study visit, which will last 2.5 hours. It will start with informed consent and then will include demographics, EEG/ERP, a multidimensional assessment of mentalization (a brief self-report questionnaire, a 5-minute speaking task, and a one-hour interview) and several clinical measures (depression, anxiety, stressful life events).\n\nParticipants will then complete 12 treatment (Mothering from the Inside Out (MIO)) visits, and 1 post-treatment data collection visit.\n\nVisits 2-13 (1 hour each) consist of participation in Mothering from the Inside Out (MIO).\n\nVisit 14 (2.5 hours) includes participation in the ERP paradigm and the multidimensional assessment of mentalization (a brief self-report questionnaire, a 5-minute speaking task, and a one-hour interview) and several clinical measures (depression, anxiety, stressful life events)."
