All participants will be instructed to switch completely from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the next 8 weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.",
            "detailedDescription": "In recent years, the prevalence of e-cigarette use has rapidly increased, especially among those with psychiatric conditions, and the risks and potential benefits of e-cigarette use have been the topic of much debate. More research is needed to understand the impact of e-cigarette use on smoking behavior and smoking-related cognitions among individuals with psychiatric conditions.\n\nThis study will investigate the effects of e-cigarette use on cigarette smoking and motivation/readiness to quit among smokers with psychiatric disorders who are not yet ready to quit smoking. A total of 50 adult daily cigarette smokers who are receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment and not yet ready to quit smoking will be recruited. All participants will be instructed to switch completely from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the next 8 weeks. E-cigarettes will be provided to participants at no cost. Participants will also be asked to complete 5 (remote and in-person) assessment sessions (i.e., baseline, 2-week, 4-week, 8-week and 12-week follow-ups)."
