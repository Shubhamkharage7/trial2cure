Each type of therapy uses different techniques and approaches to address a wide range of psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and more. The type of therapy that is most effective can vary depending on the individual and the nature of their mental health condition.</p>

                                                <li><strong>Structured and Goal-Oriented:</strong> CBT is a short-term, goal-oriented therapy that focuses on specific problems, making it effective for a wide range of mental health issues.</li>

                                            <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Psychodynamic therapy is a therapeutic approach that explores how unconscious feelings, thoughts, and past experiences influence current behavior.

                                            <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) is a structured, time-limited therapy that focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and communication skills.

                                                <li><strong>Support Through Life Transitions:</strong> IPT is particularly effective in helping people cope with major life changes, such as divorce, job loss, or the death of a loved one.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Humanistic therapy focuses on helping individuals reach their full potential and improve their self-awareness. This approach is rooted in the belief that people are inherently good and have the capacity for personal growth and self-fulfillment. Humanistic therapy is client-centered, meaning the individual takes an active role in their own healing process.</p>

                                                <li><strong>Non-Judgmental Support:</strong> The therapist provides unconditional positive regard and empathy, allowing the individual to explore their emotions without fear of judgment.</li>

                                            <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Exposure therapy is a behavioral therapy that helps individuals confront their fears and anxieties in a safe and controlled environment. The goal is to reduce the fear response associated with specific objects, situations, or memories by gradually exposing the person to them.</p>
